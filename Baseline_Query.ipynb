As an ensemble, the minimum obliquity distribution between 10 and 250 au is more consistent with a mixture of isotropic and aligned systems than either extreme scenario alone—pointing to direct cloud collapse, formation within disks bearing primordial alignments and misalignments, or architectures processed by dynamical evolution. This contrasts with stars hosting directly imaged planets, which show a preference for low obliquities. These results reinforce an emerging distinction between the orbits of long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets in terms of their stellar obliquities and orbital eccentricities.</jats:p>', 'Astrometry and Photometry for ≈1000 L, T, and Y Dwarfs from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the positions, proper motions, and near-infrared photometry for 966 known objects with spectral types later than M that were observed as part of the the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS). We augment the photometry and astrometry from UHS with information from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS DR2, and CatWISE 2020 to produce a database of homogeneous photometry and astrometry for this sample. The multi-epoch survey strategy of UHS allows us to determine the proper motions for most sources, with a median proper motion uncertainty of ∼3.6 mas yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Our UHS proper motion measurements are generally in good agreement with those from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and CatWISE 2020, with UHS proper motions typically more precise than those from CatWISE 2020 and Pan-STARRS but not Gaia DR3. We critically analyze the publicly available spectra for 406 members of this sample and provide updated near-infrared spectral types for ∼100 objects. We determine typical colors as a function of spectral type and provide absolute magnitude versus spectral type relations for UHS <jats:italic>J</jats:italic>- and <jats:italic>K</jats:italic>-band photometry.

The Rossby number also seems to be important, indicating possible dependence on the type of dynamo operating in these stars influencing their FIP bias. The two main-sequence clusters run from the earliest spectral types of A-F with shallow convection zones through G-K-early-M stars with gradually deeper convection zones, and they end with the fully convective M dwarf stars, depicting the change of the dynamo type with the internal differences of the main sequence stars in connection with the FIP-bias values.</jats:p>', 'Peculiar Radio–X-Ray Relationship in Active Stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The empirical relationship between the nonthermal 5 GHz radio luminosity and the soft X-ray luminosity of active stellar coronae, canonically called the Güdel–Benz relationship, has been a cornerstone of stellar radio astronomy, as it explicitly ties the radio emission to the coronal heating mechanisms. The relationship extends from microflares on the Sun to the coronae of the most active stars suggesting that active coronae are heated by a flare-like process. The relationship is thought to originate from a consistent partition of the available flare energy into relativistic charges, which emit in the radio-band via the <jats:italic>incoherent</jats:italic> gyrosynchrotron mechanism, and heating of the bulk coronal plasma, which emits in the X-ray band via the Bremsstrahlung mechanism. Consequently, <jats:italic>coherent</jats:italic> emission from stellar and substellar objects is not expected to adhere to this empirical relationship, as it is observed in ultracool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs. Here we report a population of radio-detected chromospherically active stars that surprisingly follow the Güdel–Benz relationship despite their radio emission being classified as coherent emission by virtue of its high circularly polarized fraction and high brightness temperature. Our results prompt a reexamination of the physics behind the Güdel–Benz relationship, its implication for the mechanism of coronal heating and particle acceleration in active stars, and the phenomenological connection between solar and stellar flares.</jats:p>', 'Visual binary stars with known orbits in <i>Gaia</i> EDR3<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>A total of 3350 objects from the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars (ORB6) are investigated to validate Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes and provide mass estimates for the systems. We show that two-thirds of binaries with a separation of 0.2–0.5 arcsec are left without a parallax solution in EDR3. Special attention is paid to 521 pairs with the parallax known separately for each component. We find 16 entries that are deemed to be chance alignments of unrelated stars. First we show examples of high-confidence binary systems with significant differences in the reported parallaxes of their components. Next we conclude that the reported Gaia EDR3 parallax errors are underestimated, by at least a factor of 3, for sources with a large renormalized unit-weight error (RUWE). Parallaxes are needed to estimate stellar masses. Because nearly 30\\xa0per\\u2009cent of ORB6 entries lack a 5- or 6-parameter solution in EDR3, we attempt to enrich the astrometric data. Distant companions of ORB6 entries are revealed in EDR3 by the analysis of stellar proper motions and Hipparcos parallaxes. Notably, in 28 cases, intrinsic EDR3 parallaxes of the binary components appear to be less reliable than the parallax of the outer companions. Gaia DR2, The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) and Hipparcos parallaxes are used when EDR3 data are unavailable. A synthetic mass–luminosity relationship in the G band for main-sequence stars is obtained to provide mass estimates along with dynamical masses calculated via Kepler’s third law.</jats:p>', '<i>Gaia</i> Early Data Release 3<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic> We produce a clean and well-characterised catalogue of objects within 100 pc of the Sun from the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> Early Data Release 3.

From measurements of altitudes and of angles between stars, given in the catalogue, we find that the measurement accuracy averages 26″ for eight fundamental stars, compared to 49″ of the measurements by Brahe. The computation in converting altitudes to declinations and angles between stars to celestial positions is very accurate, with errors that are negligible with respect to the measurement errors. Due to an offset in the position of the vernal equinox, the positional error of the catalogue is slightly worse than that of Brahe’s catalogue; however, when a correction is made for the offset, which was known to 17th century astronomers, the catalogue is more accurate than that of Brahe by a factor of two.

As an ensemble, the minimum obliquity distribution between 10 and 250 au is more consistent with a mixture of isotropic and aligned systems than either extreme scenario alone—pointing to direct cloud collapse, formation within disks bearing primordial alignments and misalignments, or architectures processed by dynamical evolution. This contrasts with stars hosting directly imaged planets, which show a preference for low obliquities. These results reinforce an emerging distinction between the orbits of long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets in terms of their stellar obliquities and orbital eccentricities.</jats:p>'], ['10.3847/1538-3881/ace9bf', 'Astrometry and Photometry for ≈1000 L, T, and Y Dwarfs from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey', '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the positions, proper motions, and near-infrared photometry for 966 known objects with spectral types later than M that were observed as part of the the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS).

Our UHS proper motion measurements are generally in good agreement with those from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and CatWISE 2020, with UHS proper motions typically more precise than those from CatWISE 2020 and Pan-STARRS but not Gaia DR3. We critically analyze the publicly available spectra for 406 members of this sample and provide updated near-infrared spectral types for ∼100 objects.

The two main-sequence clusters run from the earliest spectral types of A-F with shallow convection zones through G-K-early-M stars with gradually deeper convection zones, and they end with the fully convective M dwarf stars, depicting the change of the dynamo type with the internal differences of the main sequence stars in connection with the FIP-bias values.</jats:p>'], ['10.3847/2041-8213/ac5115', 'Peculiar Radio–X-Ray Relationship in Active Stars', '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The empirical relationship between the nonthermal 5 GHz radio luminosity and the soft X-ray luminosity of active stellar coronae, canonically called the Güdel–Benz relationship, has been a cornerstone of stellar radio astronomy, as it explicitly ties the radio emission to the coronal heating mechanisms. The relationship extends from microflares on the Sun to the coronae of the most active stars suggesting that active coronae are heated by a flare-like process. The relationship is thought to originate from a consistent partition of the available flare energy into relativistic charges, which emit in the radio-band via the <jats:italic>incoherent</jats:italic> gyrosynchrotron mechanism, and heating of the bulk coronal plasma, which emits in the X-ray band via the Bremsstrahlung mechanism. Consequently, <jats:italic>coherent</jats:italic> emission from stellar and substellar objects is not expected to adhere to this empirical relationship, as it is observed in ultracool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs. Here we report a population of radio-detected chromospherically active stars that surprisingly follow the Güdel–Benz relationship despite their radio emission being classified as coherent emission by virtue of its high circularly polarized fraction and high brightness temperature. Our results prompt a reexamination of the physics behind the Güdel–Benz relationship, its implication for the mechanism of coronal heating and particle acceleration in active stars, and the phenomenological connection between solar and stellar flares.</jats:p>'], ['10.1093/mnras/stac2827', 'Visual binary stars with known orbits in <i>Gaia</i> EDR3', '<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>A total of 3350 objects from the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars (ORB6) are investigated to validate Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes and provide mass estimates for the systems. We show that two-thirds of binaries with a separation of 0.2–0.5 arcsec are left without a parallax solution in EDR3. Special attention is paid to 521 pairs with the parallax known separately for each component. We find 16 entries that are deemed to be chance alignments of unrelated stars. First we show examples of high-confidence binary systems with significant differences in the reported parallaxes of their components. Next we conclude that the reported Gaia EDR3 parallax errors are underestimated, by at least a factor of 3, for sources with a large renormalized unit-weight error (RUWE). Parallaxes are needed to estimate stellar masses. Because nearly 30\\xa0per\\u2009cent of ORB6 entries lack a 5- or 6-parameter solution in EDR3, we attempt to enrich the astrometric data. Distant companions of ORB6 entries are revealed in EDR3 by the analysis of stellar proper motions and Hipparcos parallaxes. Notably, in 28 cases, intrinsic EDR3 parallaxes of the binary components appear to be less reliable than the parallax of the outer companions. Gaia DR2, The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) and Hipparcos parallaxes are used when EDR3 data are unavailable. A synthetic mass–luminosity relationship in the G band for main-sequence stars is obtained to provide mass estimates along with dynamical masses calculated via Kepler’s third law.</jats:p>'], ['10.1051/0004-6361/202039498', '<i>Gaia</i> Early Data Release 3', '<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic> We produce a clean and well-characterised catalogue of objects within 100 pc of the Sun from the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> Early Data Release 3.

The computation in converting altitudes to declinations and angles between stars to celestial positions is very accurate, with errors that are negligible with respect to the measurement errors. Due to an offset in the position of the vernal equinox, the positional error of the catalogue is slightly worse than that of Brahe’s catalogue; however, when a correction is made for the offset, which was known to 17th century astronomers, the catalogue is more accurate than that of Brahe by a factor of two.

The composite spectra of the DEBs were modeled by a combination of models representing the hot and cool components, and the temperatures of the hottest components of the systems were determined.

The rate of precession due to tidal effects depends on the interior structures of the stars, and as a result, binaries in which this precession occurs are of great interest. Apsidal motion is observed through the analysis of eclipse times, which reveal small changes in the average interval between successive primary and secondary eclipses, taking all available observed times of eclipse and yielding an estimate of the apsidal rate. Given that this is a single observed quantity, various degeneracies are unavoidably present. Ideally, one would have a model that predicts eclipse times given the orbital and stellar parameters. These parameters for a given binary could then be computed using least squares, provided a suitably large number of eclipse times. Here we use the eclipsing light curve (ELC) program as such a model. The Newtonian equations of motion with additional force terms accounting for GR contributions and tidal distortions are integrated, yielding precise sky positions as a function of time. Times of mid-eclipse and instantaneous orbital elements are computed as a function of time. In this paper, we outline the method and compare numerically computed apsidal rates with standard formulae using a set of 15 binaries based on real systems. For our simulated systems, the derived apsidal rates agree with the standard formula.</jats:p>', 'The BANANA Project. VI.

We determine spin–orbit angles, obliquities, in 31 of these systems making use of recently improved apsidal motion rate measurements and apsidal motion constants. In the remaining 12 systems researchers have constrained spin–orbit alignment by different combinations of measurements of apsidal motion rates, projected obliquities, and stellar inclinations. Of the 43 systems 40 are consistent with alignment albeit with some measurements having large uncertainties. A Fisher distribution with mean zero and a concentration factor <jats:italic>κ</jats:italic> = 6.1 represents this ensemble well. Indeed employing a bootstrapping resampling technique we find our data on these 40 systems are consistent with perfect alignment. We also confirm significant misalignment in two systems that travel on eccentric orbits and where misalignments have been reported on before; namely DI Her and AS Cam. The third misaligned system CV Vel orbits on a circular orbit. So while there are some glaring exceptions, the majority of close double star systems for which data are available appear to be well aligned.</jats:p>', 'TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. I.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'Pulsating B stars in the Scorpius–Centaurus Association with <i>TESS</i><jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We study 119 B stars located in the Scorpius–Centaurus Association using data from NASA’s TESS Mission. We see pulsations in 81 stars (68\\xa0per\\u2009cent) across the full range of effective temperatures. In particular, we confirm previous reports of low-frequency pulsations in stars whose temperatures fall between the instability strips of SPB stars (slowly pulsating B stars) and δ\\xa0Scuti stars. By taking the stellar densities into account, we conclude that these cannot be p\\xa0modes and confirm previous suggestions that these are probably rapidly rotating SPB stars. We also confirm that they follow two period–luminosity relations that are consistent with prograde sectoral g\\xa0modes that are dipole (l\\xa0= m\\xa0= 1) and quadrupole (l\\xa0= m\\xa0= 2), respectively. One of the stars (ξ2\\xa0Cen) is a hybrid pulsator that shows regular spacings in both g\\xa0and p\\xa0modes. We confirm that α\\xa0Cru has low-amplitude p-mode pulsations, making it one of the brightest β\\xa0Cephei stars in the sky. We also find several interesting binaries, including a very short-period heartbeat star (HD\\xa0132094), a previously unknown eclipsing binary (π\\xa0Lup), and an eclipsing binary with high-amplitude tidally driven pulsations (HR\\xa05846).

It therefore remains unclear up to what stellar mass this occurrence trend continues. The B-star Exoplanet Abundance Study (BEAST) is a direct imaging survey with the extreme adaptive optics instrument SPHERE, targeting 85 B-type stars in the young Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) region with the aim to detect giant planets at wide separations and constrain their occurrence rate and physical properties. The statistical outcome of the survey will help determine if and where an upper stellar mass limit for planet formation occurs. In this work, we describe the selection and characterization of the BEAST target sample. Particular emphasis is placed on the age of each system, which is a central parameter in interpreting direct imaging observations. We implement a novel scheme for age dating based on kinematic sub-structures within Sco-Cen, which complements and expands upon previous age determinations in the literature. We also present initial results from the first epoch observations, including the detections of ten stellar companions, of which six were previously unknown. All planetary candidates in the survey will need follow up in second epoch observations, which are part of the allocated observational programme and will be executed in the near future.</jats:p>', 'An all-sky sample of intermediate- to high-mass OBA-type eclipsing binaries observed by TESS<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic>Intermediate- to high-mass stars are the least numerous types of stars, and they are less well understood than their more numerous low-mass counterparts in terms of their internal physical processes.

High-resolution spectroscopy reveals V772\\xa0Cas to be an SB1 system, with the primary component rotating about a factor two slower than the orbital period and showing chemical peculiarities typical of non-magnetic HgMn chemically peculiar stars. This is only the third eclipsing HgMn star known and, owing to its brightness, is one of the very few eclipsing binaries with chemically peculiar components accessible to detailed follow-up studies. Taking advantage of the photometric and spectroscopic observations available for V772\\xa0Cas, we performed modelling of this system with the phoebe code. This analysis provided fundamental parameters of the components and demonstrated that the out-of-eclipse brightness variation is explained by the ellipsoidal shape of the evolved, asynchronously rotating primary.

Here we present an investigation of the known eclipsing binary system BD+09\\xa01467 = V680\\xa0Mon. Using spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and own observations, we identify the primary component of the system as a mercury–manganese (HgMn/CP3) star (spectral type kB9 hB8 HeB9\\xa0V HgMn). Furthermore, photometric time series data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) indicate that the system is a ‘heartbeat star’, a rare class of eccentric binary stars with short-period orbits that exhibit a characteristic signature near the time of periastron in their light curves due to the tidal distortion of the components. Using all available photometric observations, we present an updated ephemeris and binary system parameters as derived from a modelling of the system with the elisa code, which indicate that the secondary star has an effective temperature of Teff\\xa0= $8300_{-200}^{+200}$ (spectral type ∼A4).

These stars lack strong magnetic fields typical of magnetic Bp stars but occasionally exhibit non-uniform surface distributions of chemical elements. The physical origin and the extent of this spot formation phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we use 2-min cadence light curves of 64 HgMn stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during the first 2 yr of its operation to investigate the incidence of rotational modulation and pulsations among HgMn stars. We found rotational variability with amplitudes of 0.1–3 mmag in 84\\xa0per\\u2009cent of the targets, indicating ubiquitous presence of star-spots on HgMn-star surfaces. Rotational period measurements reveal six fast-rotating stars with periods below 1.2\\xa0d, including one ultra-fast rotator (HD\\u200914228) with a 0.34-d period. We also identify several HgMn stars showing multiperiodic g-mode pulsations, tidally induced variation and eclipses in binary systems.</jats:p>', 'New eclipsing binaries with mercury–manganese stars<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Eclipsing binary stars are rare and extremely valuable astrophysical laboratories that make possible precise determination of fundamental stellar parameters. Investigation of early-type chemically peculiar stars in eclipsing binaries provides important information for understanding the origin and evolutionary context of their anomalous surface chemistry. In this study, we discuss observations of eclipse variability in six mercury–manganese (HgMn) stars monitored by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) satellite. These discoveries double the number of known eclipsing HgMn stars and yield several interesting objects requiring further study. In particular, we confirm eclipses in HD 72208, thereby establishing this object as the longest-period eclipsing HgMn star. Among five other eclipsing binaries, reported here for the first time, HD 36892 and HD 53004 stand out as eccentric systems showing heartbeat variability in addition to eclipses. The latter object has the highest eccentricity among eclipsing HgMn stars and also exhibits tidally induced oscillations.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

The study of pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binary systems holds great potential for constraining stellar structure and evolution theory. However, prior to the all-sky Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, few such systems had been discovered or studied in detail. We have inspected the TESS light curves of a large number of eclipsing binaries known to contain high-mass stars, and compiled a list of 18 objects which show intrinsic variability. The light curves were modelled both to determine the physical properties of the systems, and to remove the effects of binarity in order to leave residual light curves suitable for asteroseismic analysis. Precise mass and radius measurements were obtained for δ\\u2009Cir, CC\\u2009Cas, SZ\\u2009Cam V436\\u2009Per and V539\\u2009Ara.

However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

We evaluated the completeness of our magnitude-limited sample of stars as well as potential observational biases affecting the compiled sample using information from the Galactic O star catalog. We discuss limitations and possible systematics of our analysis method, and compare our results with other recent studies using smaller samples of Galactic O-type stars. We mainly base our discussion on the distribution of stars in the sHR diagram in order to avoid the use of still uncertain distances to most of the stars in our sample. However, we also performed a more detailed study of the young cluster Trumpler-14 as an illustrative example of how <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> cluster distances can help to construct the associated classical HR diagram.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results.</jats:italic> We find that the apparent lack of massive O-type stars near the ZAMS with initial evolutionary masses in the range between ≈30 and 70 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> still persist even when spectroscopic results from a large non-biased sample of stars are used. We do not find any correlation between the dearth of stars close to the ZAMS and obvious observational biases, limitations of our analysis method, and/or the use of one example spectroscopic HR diagram instead of the classical HR diagram. Finally, by investigating the effect of the efficiency of mass accretion during the formation process of massive stars, we conclude that an adjustment of the mass accretion rate towards lower values than canonically assumed might reconcile the hotter boundary of the empirical distribution of optically detected O-type stars in the spectroscopic HR diagram and the theoretical birthline for stars with masses above ≈30 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>. Last, we also discuss how the presence of a small sample of O2-O3.5 stars found much closer to the ZAMS than the main distribution of Galactic O-type star might be explained in the context of this scenario when the effect of nonstandard star evolution (e.g. binary interaction, mergers, and/or homogeneous evolution) is taken into account.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae.

Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun.

Interstellar Ca\\u2009ii H &amp; K and Na\\u2009i D lines are discussed in this paper. In particular, the line profiles are compared with profiles at a comparable spectral resolution obtained in 1993–1996 by Cha\\xa0and Sembach. Ten of the lines of sight show changes to one or more of the components in that line of sight. Changes include small changes (1–2\\xa0km s−1) in radial velocity and/or increases/decreases in equivalent width over the two decades between the periods of observation. Changes are more obvious in the Ca K line than in the Na D lines. These changes are attributed to gas disturbed by interactions between the supernova ejecta and the surrounding interstellar medium. A representative time-scale may be 20–50\\xa0yr. Small-scale variations in line profiles across the face of the remnant suggest, as previously remarked, that a linear scale for interactions is a small fraction of the 40\\xa0pc size of the present remnant.</jats:p>', 'Internal motions in OB associations with Gaia DR2<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We study the motions inside 28 OB associations with the use of Gaia DR2 proper motions. The average velocity dispersion calculated for 28 OB associations including more than 20 stars with Gaia DR2 proper motion is σv\\xa0= 4.5\\xa0km s−1. The median virial and stellar masses of OB associations are Mvir\\xa0= 8.9\\xa0×\\xa0105 and Mst\\xa0= 8.1\\xa0×\\xa0103 M⊙, respectively. The median star-formation efficiency in parent giant molecular clouds appears to be ϵ\\xa0= 1.2\\xa0per\\u2009cent. Gaia DR2 proper motions confirm the expansion in the Per OB1, Car OB1, and Sgr OB1 associations found earlier with Gaia DR1 data. We also detect the expansion in Gem OB1, Ori OB1, and Sco OB1 associations, which became possible for the first time now when analysed with Gaia DR2 proper motions. The analysis of the distribution of OB stars in the Per OB1 association shows the presence of a shell-like structure with the radius of 40\\xa0pc.

The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets. It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the stellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. Nearby stars are particularly favorable targets for high precision astrometry.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions of stellar and substellar mass in orbit around nearby stars.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1−0.3\\u2006<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>J</jats:sub> to potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>orb</jats:sub>\\u2004=\\u20043 to 100 years). We confirm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> Cen. We recover the masses of the known companions of <jats:italic>ϵ</jats:italic> Eri, <jats:italic>ϵ</jats:italic> Ind, Ross 614 and <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> Pic. We also detect the signature of a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting <jats:italic>τ</jats:italic> Ceti.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A comparison of the local spiral structure from <i>Gaia</i> DR2 and VLBI maser parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

We examined three samples with different constraints on parallax uncertainty and distance errors and stellar spectral types: (1) all OB stars with parallax errors of less than 10%; (2) only O-type stars with 0.1 mas errors imposed and with parallax distance errors of less than 0.2 kpc; and (3) only O-type stars with 0.05 mas errors imposed and with parallax distance errors of less than 0.3 kpc.</jats:p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. In spite of the significant distance uncertainties for stars in DR2 beyond 1.4 kpc, the spiral structure in the solar neighborhood demonstrated by <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> agrees well with that illustrated by VLBI maser results. The O-type stars available from DR2 extend the spiral arm models determined from VLBI maser parallaxes into the fourth Galactic quadrant, and suggest the existence of a new spur between the Local and Sagittarius arms.</jats:p>', 'Infrared nebulae around bright massive stars as indicators for binary interactions<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>. Recent studies show that more than 70% of massive stars do not evolve as effectively single stars, but as members of interacting binary systems. The evolution of these stars is thus strongly altered compared to similar but isolated objects.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We investigate the occurrence of parsec-scale mid-infrared nebulae around early-type stars. If they exist over a wide range of stellar properties, one possible overarching explanation is non-conservative mass transfer in binary interactions, or stellar mergers.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. For ∼3850 stars (all OBA stars in the Bright Star Catalogue (BSC), Be stars, BeXRBs, and Be+sdO systems), we visually inspect WISE 22 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m images. Based on nebular shape and relative position, we distinguish five categories: offset bow shocks structurally aligned with the stellar space velocity, unaligned offset bow shocks, and centered, unresolved, and not classified nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>']\n",

Using TESS 20 s cadence data from Sectors 44 and 45, we show that the pulsation axis of the sdB star has been tidally tilted into the orbital plane and aligned with the tidal axis of the binary.

The study of pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binary systems holds great potential for constraining stellar structure and evolution theory. However, prior to the all-sky Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, few such systems had been discovered or studied in detail. We have inspected the TESS light curves of a large number of eclipsing binaries known to contain high-mass stars, and compiled a list of 18 objects which show intrinsic variability. The light curves were modelled both to determine the physical properties of the systems, and to remove the effects of binarity in order to leave residual light curves suitable for asteroseismic analysis.

Preliminary Orbits of K-dwarf Binaries and Other Stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>This paper details speckle observations of binary stars taken at the Lowell Discovery Telescope, the WIYN telescope, and the Gemini telescopes between 2016 January and 2019 September. The observations taken at Gemini and Lowell were done with the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI), and those done at WIYN were taken with the successor instrument to DSSI at that site, the NN-EXPLORE Exoplanet Star and Speckle Imager (NESSI). In total, we present 378 observations of 178 systems, and we show that the uncertainty in the measurement precision for the combined data set is ∼2 mas in separation, ∼1°–2° in position angle depending on the separation, and ∼0.1 mag in magnitude difference. Together with data already in the literature, these new results permit 25 visual orbits and one spectroscopic-visual orbit to be calculated for the first time. In the case of the spectroscopic-visual analysis, which is done on the ternary star HD 173093, we calculate masses with a precision of better than 1% for all three stars in that system. Twenty-one of the visual orbits calculated have a K dwarf as the primary star; we add these to the known orbits of K-dwarf primary stars and discuss the basic orbital properties of these stars at this stage. Although incomplete, the data that exist so far indicate that binaries with K-dwarf primaries tend not to have low-eccentricity orbits at separations of one to a few tens of astronomical units, that is, on solar system scales.</jats:p>']\n",

The resulting 111 sightlines towards OB-type stars have 175 reddening curves. For these stars, we derived their spectral-type from the UVES high-resolution spectroscopy. To obtain high-quality reddening curves, we excluded stars with composite spectra in the IUE/FUSE data due to multiple stellar systems. Likewise, we omitted stars that have uncertain spectral-type designations or stars with photometric variability. We neglected stars that show inconsistent parallaxes when comparing data releases two and three from <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>. Finally, we identified stars that show differences in the space- and ground-based-derived reddening curves between 0.28 µm and the <jats:italic>U</jats:italic> band or in <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>V</jats:italic></jats:sub>. In total, we find 53 stars with one or more reddening curves passing the rejection criteria. This provides the highest-quality Milky Way reddening curve sample available today.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'Local spiral structure based on the <i>Gaia</i> EDR3 parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> The astrometric satellite <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> is expected to significantly increase our knowledge as to the properties of the Milky Way.

We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', 'The Interstellar 2200 Å Band: A Catalogue of Equivalent Widths (Mitteilungen der Universitäts‐Sternwarte zu Jena Nr. 151)<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Using the data of the Ultraviolet Bright‐Star Spectrophotometric Catalogue, the equivalent width of the interstellar absorption band at 2200 Å is derived for 422 stars.

The often complex and diverse variability of each object in this sample is classified to obtain an understanding of the behavior of this class as a population. Ninety-seven percent of the systems are variable above the noise level, with timescales spanning nearly the entire range of what is accessible with TESS, from tens of minutes to tens of days. The variability seen with TESS is summarized as follows. Nearly every system contains multiple periodic signals in the frequency regime between about 0.5 and 4 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. One or more groups of closely spaced frequencies is the most common feature, present in 87% of the sample. Among the Be stars with brightening events that are characteristic of mass ejection episodes (18% of the full sample, or 31% of early-type stars), all have at least one frequency group, and the majority of these (83%) show a concurrent temporary amplitude enhancement in one or more frequency groups. About one-third (34%) of the sample is dominated by longer-term trends (timescales &gt;2 day). Low-frequency stochastic signals are prominent in about 25% of the sample, with varying degrees of intensity. Higher-frequency signals (6 &lt; <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> &lt; 15 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) are sometimes seen (in 15% of the sample) and in most cases likely reflect p-mode pulsation.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results.

The disk phenomenon is strongly correlated with rapid rotation, the origin of which remains unclear. It may be rooted in single- or binary-star evolution. In the framework of the binary channel, the initially more massive star transfers mass and angular momentum to the original secondary, which becomes a Be star. The system then evolves into a Be binary with a post-main-sequence companion, which, depending on the companion mass, may later be disrupted in a supernova event. Hence, if the binary channel dominates the formation of Be stars, one may expect a strong lack of close Be binaries with main sequence (MS) companions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic>We want to test the prediction of the binary channel.

For the remaining 263 targets, no significant reports of multiplicity exist in the literature, implying that they are either Be binaries with faint companions, or truly single.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic>The clear lack of reported MS companions to Be stars, which stands in contrast to the high number of detected B+B MS binaries, strongly supports the hypothesis that early-type Be stars are binary interaction products that spun up after mass and angular momentum transfer from a companion star.

We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets.

We confirm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> Cen. We recover the masses of the known companions of <jats:italic>ϵ</jats:italic> Eri, <jats:italic>ϵ</jats:italic> Ind, Ross 614 and <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> Pic. We also detect the signature of a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting <jats:italic>τ</jats:italic> Ceti.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A comparison of the local spiral structure from <i>Gaia</i> DR2 and VLBI maser parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

The binary fraction depends strongly on stellar density. Among the four types of cluster environments, the lowest-density filamentary and fractal stellar groups have the highest mean binary fraction: 23.6% and 23.2%, respectively. The mean binary fraction in tidal tail clusters is 20.8% and is lowest in the densest halo-type clusters: 14.8%. We find clear evidence of early disruptions of binary stars in the cluster sample.

The amplitude variation between stars of a given age is large, but the age–variability relation becomes strong over large groups of stars. We explore this relation using the excess photometric uncertainty in Gaia photometry (<jats:italic>V</jats:italic>ar<jats:sub>G</jats:sub>, <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>ar<jats:sub>BP</jats:sub>, and <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>ar<jats:sub>RP</jats:sub>) as a proxy for variability.

By calibrating against a set of associations with known ages, we show how the <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>ar of population members can predict group ages within 10%–20% for associations younger than ≃2.5 Gyr. In practice, age uncertainties are larger, primarily due to the finite group size. The index is most useful at the youngest ages (&lt;100 Myr), where the uncertainties are comparable to or better than those derived from a color–magnitude diagram (CMD). The index is also widely available, easy to calculate, and can be used at intermediate ages where there are few or no pre- or post-main-sequence stars. We further show how <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>ar can be used to find new associations and test if a group of comoving stars is a real coeval population. We apply our methods to Theia groups within 350 pc and find ≳90% are inconsistent with drawing stars from the field and ≃80% have variability ages consistent with those derived from the CMD. Our findings suggest the great majority of these groups contain real populations.</jats:p>', 'A low-mass companion desert among intermediate-mass visual binaries: The scaled-up counterpart to the brown dwarf desert<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present a high-contrast imaging survey of intermediate-mass (1.75–4.5\\u2009M⊙) stars to search the most extreme stellar binaries, i.e. for the lowest mass stellar companions. Using adaptive optics at the Lick and Gemini observatories, we observed 169 stars and detected 24 candidates companions, 16 of which are newly discovered, and all but three are likely or confirmed physical companions. Despite obtaining sensitivity down to the substellar limit for 75\\xa0per\\u2009cent of our sample, we do not detect any companion below 0.3\\u2009M⊙, strongly suggesting that the distribution of stellar companions is truncated at a mass ratio of qmin ≳ 0.075. Combining our results with known brown dwarf companions, we identify a low-mass companion desert to intermediate-mass stars in the range 0.02 ≲ q ≲ 0.05, which quantitatively matches the known brown dwarf desert among solar-type stars. We conclude that the formation mechanism for multiple systems operates in a largely scale-invariant manner and precludes the formation of extremely uneven systems, likely because the components of a protobinary accrete most of their mass after the initial cloud fragmentation. Similarly, the mechanism to form ‘planetary’ (q ≲ 0.02) companions likely scales linearly with stellar mass, probably as a result of the correlation between the masses of stars and their protoplanetary discs. Finally, we predict the existence of a sizable population of brown dwarf companions to low-mass stars and of a rising population of planetary-mass objects towards ${\\\\approx}1\\\\,M_\\\\mathrm{Jup}$ around solar-type stars. Improvements on current instrumentation will test these predictions.</jats:p>', 'The origin of early-type runaway stars from open clusters<jats:p>Runaway stars are ejected from their place of birth in the Galactic disk, with some young B-type runaways found several tens of kiloparsecs from the plane traveling at speeds beyond the escape velocity, which calls for violent ejection processes. Young open clusters are a likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-body interactions or in binary supernova explosions. The most energetic events may require dynamical interaction with massive black holes. The excellent quality of <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> astrometry opens up the path to study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high precision that the place of origin in open stellar clusters can be identified uniquely even when the star is a few kiloparsecs away. We developed an efficient minimization method to calculate whether two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against samples of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate trajectories for known runaway stars, which have previously been studied from H<jats:sc>IPPARCOS</jats:sc> astrometry as well as known open clusters. For runaways in our sample we used <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> data and updated radial velocities, and found that only half of the sample could be classified as runaways. The other half of the sample moves so slowly (&lt; 30 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) that they have to be considered as walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their trajectories. We then used cluster age and flight time of the stars to investigate whether the ejection was likely due to a binary supernova or due to a dynamical ejection. In particular we show that the classical runaways AE Aurigae and <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic> Columbae might not have originated together, with <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic> Columbae having an earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC. The second sample investigated comprises a set of distant runaway B stars in the halo which have been studied carefully by quantitative spectral analyses. We are able to identify candidate parent clusters for at least four stars including the hyper-runaway candidate HIP 60350.

We explore quantitatively how much resulting large-scale correlation there is among different stellar clusters and associations in orbit-phase space, characterized here by actions and angles. As a starting point, we identified 55 prominent stellar overdensities in the 6D space of orbit (actions) and orbit-phase (angles) among the ∼2.8 million stars with radial velocities from Gaia EDR3 and with <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> ≤ 800 pc. We then explored the orbit-phase distribution of all sample stars in the same orbit patch as any one of these 55 overdensities. We find that very commonly numerous other distinct orbit-phase overdensities exist along these same orbits, like pearls on a string. These “pearls” range from known stellar clusters to loose, unrecognized associations. Among orbit patches defined by one initial orbit-phase overdensity, 50% contain at least 8 additional orbit-phase pearls of 10 cataloged members; 20% of them contain 20 additional pearls. This is in contrast to matching orbit patches sampled from a smooth mock catalog, or offset nearby orbit patches, where there are only 2 (or 5, respectively) comparable pearls. Our findings quantify for the first time how common it is for star clusters and associations to form at distinct orbit-phases of nearly the same orbit. This may eventually offer a new way to probe the 6D orbit structure of the filamentary interstellar medium.</jats:p>', 'Residual Abundances in GALAH DR3: Implications for Nucleosynthesis and Identification of Unique Stellar Populations<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We investigate the [X/Mg] abundances of 16 elements for 82,910 Galactic disk stars from GALAH+ DR3. We fit the median trends of low-Ia and high-Ia populations with a two-process model, which describes stellar abundances in terms of a prompt core-collapse and delayed Type-Ia supernova component. For each sample star, we fit the amplitudes of these two components and compute the residual Δ[X/H] abundances from this two-parameter fit. We find rms residuals ≲0.07 dex for well-measured elements and correlated residuals among some elements (such as Ba, Y, and Zn) that indicate common enrichment sources. From a detailed investigation of stars with large residuals, we infer that roughly 40% of the large deviations are physical and 60% are caused by problematic data such as unflagged binarity, poor wavelength solutions, and poor telluric subtraction. As one example of a population with distinctive abundance patterns, we identify 15 stars that have 0.3–0.6 dex enhancements of Na but normal abundances of other elements from O to Ni and positive average residuals of Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba. We measure the median elemental residuals of 14 open clusters, finding systematic ∼0.1–0.4 dex enhancements of O, Ca, K, Y, and Ba and ∼0.2 dex depletion of Cu in young clusters. Finally, we present a restricted three-process model where we add an asymptotic giant branch star (AGB) component to better fit Ba and Y. With the addition of the third process, we identify a population of stars, preferentially young, that have much higher AGB enrichment than expected from their SNIa enrichment.</jats:p>']\n",

This adds additional support to the hypothesis that Wd1 is a multiage cluster with an older age than previously assumed, and is not a ∼5 Myr old cluster caught at a very specific transitional point when single-star evolution might yield Wolf–Rayet stars, luminous blue variables, RSGs, and YHGs in the same cluster. Nevertheless, the population of YSGs in Wd1 is very unusual, with YSGs outnumbering RSGs, but with both spanning a large luminosity range. Here, we discuss evolutionary scenarios that might have led to the high fraction of YSGs. The number of YSGs and their significant luminosity spread cannot be explained by simple population synthesis models with single or binary stars. Even with multiple ages or a large age spread, the high YSG/RSG ratio remains problematic. We suggest instead that the objects may experience a prolonged YSG phase due to evolution in triple systems.</jats:p>', 'Multiplicity of Galactic luminous blue variable stars<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are characterised by strong photometric and spectroscopic variability.

The catalog consists of 364 bright northern hemisphere stars, including all but five such stars with either <jats:italic>V</jats:italic> &lt; 3.5 or with <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> &lt; 3.2 and <jats:italic>V</jats:italic> &lt; 6, as well as a large fraction of slightly fainter stars; 36 of the brightest catalog stars are not included in Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). Observations were conducted with the USNO Flagstaff Station Kaj Strand 61 inch Astrometric Reflector. Target stars were imaged through a small 12.5 mag neutral-density spot, while the remainder of the stars in the field of view were unattenuated. This allowed for unsaturated images of the bright target stars to be calibrated directly against much fainter reference stars from Gaia EDR3. The median position errors are 1.9 mas in both R.A. and decl. at the catalog epoch of 2017.0, with 90% of catalog stars having errors less than 2.6 mas; systematic errors are 1–3 mas. Combining UBAD observations with Hipparcos-2 positions yields proper motions with median errors of 0.045 and 0.049 mas yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in R.A. and decl., respectively, with 90% of stars having errors less than 0.1 mas yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; systematic errors are about 0.1 mas yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Single-frame accuracy for positions of the target stars is typically 5–6 mas.

We conducted monitoring observations using multifilter optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy, to understand the physical properties of Gaia19fct and investigate whether it fits into the historically defined two classes. We present the analyses of light curves, color variations, spectral lines, and CO modeling. The light curves show at least five brightening events since 2015, and the multifilter color evolutions are mostly gray. The gray evolution indicates that bursts are triggered by mechanisms other than extinction. Our near-infrared spectra exhibit both absorption and emission lines and show time variability throughout our observations. We found lower rotational velocity and lower temperature from the near-infrared atomic absorption lines than from the optical lines, suggesting that Gaia19fct has a Keplerian rotating disk. The CO overtone features show a superposition of absorption and emission components, which is unlike other young stellar objects. We modeled the CO lines, and the result suggests that the emission and absorption components are formed in different regions. We found that although Gaia19fct exhibits characteristics of both types of eruptive young stars, FU Orionis–type objects and EX Lupi–type objects, it shows more similarity with EXors in general.</jats:p>', 'Revisiting the evolved hypergiants in the Magellanic Clouds<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The massive stars that survive the phase of red supergiants (RSGs) spend the rest of their life in extremity. Their unstable atmospheres facilitate the formation and episodic ejection of shells that alter the stellar appearance and surroundings. In the present study, we revise the evolutionary state of eight hypergiants in the Magellanic Clouds, four of early-A type and four of FG type, and complement the short list of the eruptive post-RSGs termed as yellow hypergiants. We refine the outdated temperatures and luminosities of the stars by means of high-resolution spectroscopy with the Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS). The A-type stars are suggested to be in their early, post-main-sequence phase, showing spectrophotometric characteristics of redward evolving supergiants. On the other hand, the FG-type stars manifest themselves through the enhanced atmospheric activity that is traced by emission filling in H\\u2009α and the dynamical modulation of the low-excitation Ba\\u2009ii line. Of these stars, the dusty HD269723 is suggested to have recently departed from a cool phase. We identify double-peaked emission in the FEROS data of HD269953 that emerges from an orbiting disc-hosting companion. The highlight of the study is an episode of enhanced mass-loss of HD271182 that manifests as a dimming event in the light curve and renders the star ‘modest’ analogue to ρ Cas. The luminosity log\\u2009(L/L⊙)\\xa0= 5.6 of HD271182 can serve as an updated threshold for the luminosity of stars exhibiting a post-RSG evolution in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</jats:p>', 'Wind-envelope interaction as the origin of the slow cyclic brightness variations of luminous blue variables<jats:p>Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are hot, very luminous massive stars displaying large quasi-periodic variations in brightness, radius, and photospheric temperature on timescales of years to decades. The physical origin of this variability, called S Doradus cycle after its prototype, has remained elusive. We study the feedback of stellar wind mass-loss on the envelope structure in stars near the Eddington limit. We calculated a time-dependent hydrodynamic stellar evolution, applying a stellar wind mass-loss prescription with a temperature dependence inspired by the predicted systematic increase in mass-loss rates below 25 kK. We find that when the wind mass-loss rate crosses a well-defined threshold, a discontinuous change in the wind base conditions leads to a restructuring of the stellar envelope. The induced drastic radius and temperature changes, which occur on the thermal timescale of the inflated envelope, in turn impose mass-loss variations that reverse the initial changes, leading to a cycle that lacks a stationary equilibrium configuration. Our proof-of-concept model broadly reproduces the typical observational phenomenology of the S Doradus variability. We identify three key physical ingredients that are required to trigger the instability: inflated envelopes in close proximity to the Eddington limit, a temperature range where decreasing opacities do not lead to an accelerating outflow, and a mass-loss rate that increases with decreasing temperature, crossing a critical threshold value within this temperature range. Our scenario and model provide testable predictions, and open the door for a consistent theoretical treatment of the LBV phase in stellar evolution, with consequences for their further evolution as single stars or in binary systems.</jats:p>']\n",

With 83 known red giants in binary systems, of which only ∼40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample is small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time base of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient size to allow a red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few stars in the He-core burning phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic>, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were previously unknown to host an oscillating giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26 000 days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar evolution from binary studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies.

WD cooling ages can be inferred from surface temperatures and radii, which can be constrained with precision by high-quality photometry and parallaxes. Accurate and precise Gaia parallaxes along with photometric surveys provide information to derive cooling and total ages for vast numbers of WDs. Here we analyze 1372 WDs found in wide binaries with main-sequence (MS) companions and report on the cooling and total age precision attainable in these WD+MS systems. The total age of a WD can be further constrained if its original metallicity is known because the MS lifetime depends on metallicity at fixed mass, yet metallicity is unavailable via spectroscopy of the WD. We show that incorporating spectroscopic metallicity constraints from 38 wide binary MS companions substantially decreases internal uncertainties in WD total ages compared to a uniform constraint. Averaged over the 38 stars in our sample, the total (internal) age uncertainty improves from 21.04% to 16.77% when incorporating the spectroscopic constraint.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>']\n",

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous.

It gathers data for half a million stars, i.e. nearly all the stars of the Hipparcos-Tycho catalogue whose spectral type is reported in the SIMBAD data base. We cross-match 26 data bases to provide basic information, binarity elements, angular diameter, magnitude and flux in the near and mid-infrared, as well as flags that allow us to identify the potential calibrators. The catalogue covers the entire sky with 465\\u2009857 stars, mainly dwarfs and giants from B to M spectral types closer than 18\\xa0kpc. The smallest reported values reach 0.16\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in L and 0.1\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in N for the flux, and 2\\xa0microarcsec for the angular diameter. We build four lists of calibrator candidates for the L and Nbands suitable with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) sub- and main arrays using the MATISSE instrument. We identify 1621 candidates for L and 44 candidates for N with the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), 375 candidates for both bands with the ATs, and 259 candidates for both bands with the Unit Telescopes (UTs). Predominantly cool giants, these sources are small and bright enough to belong to the primary lists of calibrator candidates.

By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>', 'A new catalogue of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>A new catalogue of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits is presented.

I did it again: unveiling the hidden companion in Upsilon Sagittarii, a unique binary system at a second mass transfer stage<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Upsilon Sagittarii is a hydrogen-deficient binary that has been suggested to be in its second stage of mass transfer, after the primary has expanded to become a helium supergiant following core helium exhaustion. A tentative identification of the faint companion in the ultraviolet led to mass estimates of both components that made the helium star in Upsilon Sagittarii a prototypical immediate progenitor of a type Ib/c supernova. However, no consistent model for the complex spectrum has been achieved, casting doubt on this interpretation. In this study, we provide for the first time a composite spectral model that fits the ultraviolet data, and clearly identifies the companion as a rapidly rotating, slowly moving $\\\\approx 7\\\\, \\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\odot$ B-type star, unlike previously suggested. The stripped helium supergiant is less luminous than previous estimates, and with an estimated mass of $\\\\lt 1\\\\, \\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\odot$ is ruled out as a core-collapse supernova progenitor. We provide a detailed binary evolution scenario that explains the temperature and luminosity of the two components as well as the very low gravity (log\\u2009g ≈ 1) and extreme hydrogen deficiency of the primary (atmospheric mass fraction XH, 1 ≈ 0.001). The best-fitting model is an intermediate-mass primary ($M_\\\\mathrm{ZAMS,1} \\\\approx 5\\\\, \\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\odot$) with an initial orbital period of a few days, and a secondary that appears to have gained a significant amount of mass despite its high rotation. We conclude that Upsilon Sagittarii is a key system for testing binary evolution processes, especially envelope stripping and mass accretion.</jats:p>', '<i>TESS</i> uncloaks the secondaries in hydrogen-deficient binaries<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>υ \\u2009Sgr is the prototype of four known hydrogen-deficient binary (HdB) systems. These are characterized by a hydrogen-deficient A-type primary, variable hydrogen emission lines, and a normally unseen secondary presumed to be an upper main-sequence star. Orbital periods range from tens of days to 360\\u2009d. TESS observations of all four HdBs show a flux variation with well-defined period in the range 0.5–0.9\\u2009d, too short to be associated with the supergiant primary, and more likely to be the rotation period of the secondary and associated with a chemical surface asymmetry or a low-order non-radial oscillation. The observed rotation period supports a recent analysis of the υ\\u2009Sgr secondary. The observations give a direct glimpse of the secondary in all four systems, and should help to explain how the primary has been stripped to become a low-mass hydrogen remnant.</jats:p>', 'Interferometric Detections of sdO Companions Orbiting Three Classical Be Stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Classical Be stars are possible products of close binary evolution, in which the mass donor becomes a hot, stripped O- or B-type subdwarf (sdO/sdB), and the mass gainer spins up and grows a disk to become a Be star. While several Be+sdO binaries have been identified, dynamical masses and other fundamental parameters are available only for a single Be+sdO system, limiting the confrontation with binary evolution models. In this work, we present direct interferometric detections of the sdO companions of three Be stars—28 Cyg, V2119 Cyg, and 60 Cyg—all of which were previously found in UV spectra. For two of the three Be+sdO systems, we present first orbits and preliminary dynamical masses of the components, revealing that one of them could be the first identified progenitor of a Be/X-ray binary with a neutron star companion. These results provide new sets of fundamental parameters that are crucially needed to establish the evolutionary status and origin of Be stars.</jats:p>', 'The Magnetic Field of the Stripped Primary in the υ Sgr System, a Member of the Rare Class of Hydrogen-deficient Binaries<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the results of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the optically dominant component in the rare hydrogen-deficient binary system <jats:italic>υ</jats:italic> Sgr. Only a small number of such systems in a very late phase of helium shell burning are currently known. The mass transfer from the donor star in binary systems usually leads to the stripping of its hydrogen envelope. Consequently, since the mass of the secondary increases, it appears rejuvenated. Using a few ESO FORS 1 low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of this system, Hubrig et al. announced in 2009 the presence of a magnetic field of the order of −70 to −80 G. Here we report on more recent high-resolution ESO HARPS spectropolarimetric observations showing that the primary in <jats:italic>υ</jats:italic> Sgr is a spectrum variable star and possesses a weak magnetic field of the order of a few tens of Gauss. The detection of a magnetic field in this rare hydrogen-deficient binary is of particular interest, as such systems are frequently discussed as probable progenitors of core-collapse supernovae and gravitational-wave sources. Future magnetic studies of such systems would be worthwhile to gain deeper insights into the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of massive stars in binary systems.</jats:p>', 'Local spiral structure based on the <i>Gaia</i> EDR3 parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> The astrometric satellite <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> is expected to significantly increase our knowledge as to the properties of the Milky Way.

Recently, a lot of new observational data have accumulated for various types of stars. To summarize information about magnetic variability, we present the second version of the catalog of average magnetic phase curves. The curves are obtained from literary data and as a result of observations from SAO RAS telescopes. A total of 357 stars of various spectral types were studied based on data that was published before the end of August 2020. Magnetic Ap and Bp stars make up the most numerous subset in the catalog (224 objects). The phase curves were obtained by least-squares fit of the simple sine wave or double sine wave, which are presented in uniform form. The parameters of variability of these objects are presented in tabular form; the upper limits of observed magnetic fields of various types are indicated. The information is presented in a convenient form for verification of various kinds of theoretical models. For clarity and ease of use, phase dependences are presented in graphic form in 514 figures. Periods of variability are defined or refined for a number of stars. The created catalog allows the estimation of the limits of the observed magnetic field variability for various types of stars and the estimation of the energy of the magnetic fields of stars. The catalog will be useful for the development of observation programs. The catalog facilitates the study of the orientation of the axes of rotation of stars in space, the investigation of the interactions of magnetic fields of stars with the interstellar medium, and the “magnetic braking” mechanism. This catalog also permits the study of the orientation of the orbits of planets for some stars with planets and planetary systems.</jats:p>', 'Surveying the Bright Stars by Optical Interferometry.

A Magnitude-limited Multiplicity Survey of Classical Be Stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the results of a multiplicity survey for a magnitude-limited sample of 31 classical Be stars conducted with the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer and the Mark III Stellar Interferometer. The interferometric observations were used to detect companions in 10 previously known binary systems. For two of these sources (66 Oph and <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> Cep) new orbital solutions were obtained, while for a third source (<jats:italic>υ</jats:italic> Sgr) our observations provide the first direct, visual detection of the hot companion to the primary star.

Among the sources not previously confirmed as spectroscopic or visual binaries, BK Cam was resolved on a number of nights within a close physical proximity of another star with relative motion possibly suggesting a physical binary. Combining our interferometric observations with an extensive literature search, we provide a detailed listing of companions known around each star in the sample, and discuss the multiplicity frequency in the sample. We also discuss the prospects for future multiplicity studies of classical Be stars by long-baseline optical interferometry.</jats:p>', 'Magnetic chemically peculiar stars investigated by the Solar Mass Ejection Imager<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Since the discovery of the spectral peculiarities of their prototype α2 Canum Venaticorum in 1897, the so-called ACV variables, which are comprised of several groups of chemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence, have been the target of numerous photometric and spectroscopic studies. Especially for the brighter ACV variables, continuous observations over about a century are available, which are important to study long-term effects such as period changes or magnetic cycles in these objects. This work presents an analysis of 165 Ap/CP2 and He-weak/CP4 stars using light curves obtained by the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) between the years 2003 and 2011. These data fill an important gap in observations for bright ACV variables between the Hipparcos and TESS satellite missions. Using specifically tailored data treatment and period search approaches, we find variability in the accuracy limit of the employed data in 84 objects. The derived periods are in excellent agreement with the literature; for one star, the here presented solution represents the first published period. We discuss the apparently constant stars and the corresponding level of non-variability. From an investigation of our target star sample in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, we deduce ages between 100\\u2009Myr and 1\\u2009Gyr for the majority of our sample stars. Our results support that the variable CP2/4 stars are in a more advanced evolutionary state and that He and Si peculiarities, preferentially found in the hotter, and thus more massive, CP stars, produce larger spots or spots of higher contrast.</jats:p>']\n",

We have inspected the TESS light curves of a large number of eclipsing binaries known to contain high-mass stars, and compiled a list of 18 objects which show intrinsic variability.

The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A comparison of the local spiral structure from <i>Gaia</i> DR2 and VLBI maser parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

Recent studies show that more than 70% of massive stars do not evolve as effectively single stars, but as members of interacting binary systems. The evolution of these stars is thus strongly altered compared to similar but isolated objects.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We investigate the occurrence of parsec-scale mid-infrared nebulae around early-type stars. If they exist over a wide range of stellar properties, one possible overarching explanation is non-conservative mass transfer in binary interactions, or stellar mergers.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. For ∼3850 stars (all OBA stars in the Bright Star Catalogue (BSC), Be stars, BeXRBs, and Be+sdO systems), we visually inspect WISE 22 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m images. Based on nebular shape and relative position, we distinguish five categories: offset bow shocks structurally aligned with the stellar space velocity, unaligned offset bow shocks, and centered, unresolved, and not classified nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>', 'A new catalogue of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>A new catalogue of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits is presented.

When comparing these percentages with those corresponding to the slow-rotating sample, we find that our sample of fast rotators is characterised by a slightly larger percentage of SB1 systems (∼18% vs. ∼13%) and a considerably smaller fraction of clearly detected SB2 systems (8% vs. 33%). Overall, there seems to be a clear deficit of spectroscopic binaries (SB1+SB2) among fast-rotating O-type stars (∼26% vs. ∼46%).

The disk phenomenon is strongly correlated with rapid rotation, the origin of which remains unclear. It may be rooted in single- or binary-star evolution. In the framework of the binary channel, the initially more massive star transfers mass and angular momentum to the original secondary, which becomes a Be star. The system then evolves into a Be binary with a post-main-sequence companion, which, depending on the companion mass, may later be disrupted in a supernova event. Hence, if the binary channel dominates the formation of Be stars, one may expect a strong lack of close Be binaries with main sequence (MS) companions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic>We want to test the prediction of the binary channel.

The targets were selected either on the basis of a previous X-ray detection (exosat,rosat, XMM-slew survey) without spectral information available or because of the presence of a peculiar spectral variability. Only two targets remain undetected in the new observations and three other stars display only faint and soft X-rays. Short-term and/or long-term variations were found in one third of the sample.

By taking the stellar densities into account, we conclude that these cannot be p\\xa0modes and confirm previous suggestions that these are probably rapidly rotating SPB stars. We also confirm that they follow two period–luminosity relations that are consistent with prograde sectoral g\\xa0modes that are dipole (l\\xa0= m\\xa0= 1) and quadrupole (l\\xa0= m\\xa0= 2), respectively. One of the stars (ξ2\\xa0Cen) is a hybrid pulsator that shows regular spacings in both g\\xa0and p\\xa0modes.

The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets. It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the stellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. Nearby stars are particularly favorable targets for high precision astrometry.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions of stellar and substellar mass in orbit around nearby stars.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1−0.3\\u2006<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>J</jats:sub> to potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>orb</jats:sub>\\u2004=\\u20043 to 100 years).

Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>', 'Binary Star Observations in Selected Instants of Good Seeing<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Video recordings of images of binary stars at the focus of a 0.36m telescope have been used to select images recorded in instants of good seeing. The selected images have been analysed to give separations and position angles for the binary systems which are in good agreement with values predicted from previous observations. In these exploratory observations it has been shown that separations of 0.9 arcseconds can be measured with an accuracy of ~2% and position angles to ~1–2 degrees when the average seeing was ~1.3 arcseconds. These observations demonstrated that the diffraction limit of the telescope could be reached when the seeing was a factor of 2–3 greater than it. A binary with three magnitudes difference in the brightness of its components has been measured with comparable accuracy although difficulties are anticipated for binaries with components closer than ~2 arcseconds with this magnitude difference. The limiting magnitude is determined by the need to limit exposure times of individual frames to be comparable with or less than the atmospheric coherence time.</jats:p>']\n",

The updated statistics on the masses of the two post-AGB main components reveal that there are two distinct subclasses of nebulae around binary post-AGB stars depending on which component is the dominant one. We speculate that the absence of an intermediate subclass of sources is due to the different initial conditions of the stellar system and not because both subclasses are in different stages of the post-AGB evolution.</jats:p>', 'Three-dimensional Orbit of AC Her Determined: Binary-induced Truncation Cannot Explain the Large Cavity in This Post-AGB Transition Disk<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Some evolved binaries, namely post–asymptotic giant branch (AGB) binaries, are surrounded by stable and massive circumbinary disks similar to protoplanetary disks found around young stars. Around 10% of these disks are transition disks: they have a large inner cavity in the dust. Previous interferometric measurements and modeling have ruled out these cavities being formed by dust sublimation and suggested that they are due to massive circumbinary planets that trap dust in the disk and produce the observed depletion of refractory elements on the surfaces of the post-AGB stars. In this study, we test an alternative scenario in which the large cavities could be due to dynamical truncation from the inner binary. We performed near-infrared interferometric observations with the CHARA Array on the archetype of such a transition disk around a post-AGB binary: AC Her. We detect the companion at ten epochs over 4 yr and determine the three-dimensional orbit using these astrometric measurements in combination with a radial velocity time series. This is the first astrometric orbit constructed for a post-AGB binary system. We derive the best-fit orbit with a semimajor axis of 2.01 ± 0.01 mas (2.83 ± 0.08 au), inclination (142.9 ± 1.1)°, and longitude of the ascending node (155.1 ± 1.8)°. We find that the theoretical dynamical truncation and dust sublimation radii are at least ∼3× smaller than the observed inner disk radius (∼21.5 mas or 30 au). This strengthens the hypothesis that the origin of the cavity is due to the presence of a circumbinary planet.</jats:p>', 'Circumbinary discs for stellar population models<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We develop a rapid algorithm for the evolution of stable, circular, circumbinary discs suitable for parameter estimation and population synthesis modelling.

We interpret this correlation as evidence of the presence of a mechanism that stimulates the dust and gas separation within the disk and that also produces the transition disk structure. We propose that such a mechanism is likely to be due to a giant planet carving a hole in the disk, effectively trapping the dust in the outer disk parts. We propose two disk evolutionary scenarios, depending on the actual presence of such a giant planet in the disk.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> We advocate that giant planets can successfully explain the correlation between the transition disks and the depletion of refractory materials observed in post-AGB binaries. If the planetary scenario is confirmed, disks around post-AGB binaries could be a unique laboratory for testing planet-disk interactions and their influence on the late evolution of binary stars. The question of whether such planets are first- or second-generation bodies also remains to be considered. We argue that these disks are ideal for studying planet formation scenarios in an unprecedented parameter space.</jats:p>', 'Chemistry of nebulae around binary post-AGB stars: A molecular survey of mm-wave lines<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> There is a class of binary post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars that exhibit remarkable near-infrared excess.

We conclude that the molecular content is relatively low in nebulae around binary post-AGB stars, as their molecular lines and abundances are especially weaker compared with AGB stars. This fact is very significant in those sources where the Keplerian disk is the dominant component of the nebula. The study of their chemistry allows us to classify nebulae around AC Her, the Red Rectangle, AI CMi, R Sct, and IRAS 20056+1834 as O-rich, while that of 89 Her is probably C-rich.

The often complex and diverse variability of each object in this sample is classified to obtain an understanding of the behavior of this class as a population. Ninety-seven percent of the systems are variable above the noise level, with timescales spanning nearly the entire range of what is accessible with TESS, from tens of minutes to tens of days. The variability seen with TESS is summarized as follows. Nearly every system contains multiple periodic signals in the frequency regime between about 0.5 and 4 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. One or more groups of closely spaced frequencies is the most common feature, present in 87% of the sample. Among the Be stars with brightening events that are characteristic of mass ejection episodes (18% of the full sample, or 31% of early-type stars), all have at least one frequency group, and the majority of these (83%) show a concurrent temporary amplitude enhancement in one or more frequency groups. About one-third (34%) of the sample is dominated by longer-term trends (timescales &gt;2 day). Low-frequency stochastic signals are prominent in about 25% of the sample, with varying degrees of intensity. Higher-frequency signals (6 &lt; <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> &lt; 15 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) are sometimes seen (in 15% of the sample) and in most cases likely reflect p-mode pulsation. In rare cases (∼3%), even higher frequencies beyond the traditional p-mode regime (<jats:italic>f</jats:italic> &gt; 15 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) are observed.</jats:p>', 'Investigating the lack of main-sequence companions to massive Be stars<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic>About 20% of all B-type stars are classical Be stars – stars whose spectra imply the presence of a circumstellar decretion disk. The disk phenomenon is strongly correlated with rapid rotation, the origin of which remains unclear. It may be rooted in single- or binary-star evolution. In the framework of the binary channel, the initially more massive star transfers mass and angular momentum to the original secondary, which becomes a Be star. The system then evolves into a Be binary with a post-main-sequence companion, which, depending on the companion mass, may later be disrupted in a supernova event. Hence, if the binary channel dominates the formation of Be stars, one may expect a strong lack of close Be binaries with main sequence (MS) companions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic>We want to test the prediction of the binary channel.

Out of those, 13 objects were reported as Be binaries with known post-MS companions (i.e., compact objects or helium stars) and 11 as binaries with unknown, uncertain or debated companions. We find no confirmed reports of Be binaries with MS companions. For the remaining 263 targets, no significant reports of multiplicity exist in the literature, implying that they are either Be binaries with faint companions, or truly single.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic>The clear lack of reported MS companions to Be stars, which stands in contrast to the high number of detected B+B MS binaries, strongly supports the hypothesis that early-type Be stars are binary interaction products that spun up after mass and angular momentum transfer from a companion star. Taken at face value, our results may suggest that a large majority of the early-type Be stars have formed through binary mass-transfer.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae.

Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', 'The total‐to‐selective extinction ratio determined from near IR photometry of OB stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The paper presents an extensive list of the total to selective extinction ratios <jats:bold>R</jats:bold> calculated from the infrared magnitudes of 597 O and B stars using the extrapolation method.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars.

In these exploratory observations it has been shown that separations of 0.9 arcseconds can be measured with an accuracy of ~2% and position angles to ~1–2 degrees when the average seeing was ~1.3 arcseconds. These observations demonstrated that the diffraction limit of the telescope could be reached when the seeing was a factor of 2–3 greater than it. A binary with three magnitudes difference in the brightness of its components has been measured with comparable accuracy although difficulties are anticipated for binaries with components closer than ~2 arcseconds with this magnitude difference.

This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A catalogue of stellar diameters and fluxes for mid-infrared interferometry★<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the Mid-infrared stellar Diameters and Fluxes compilation Catalogue (MDFC) dedicated to long-baseline interferometry at mid-infrared wavelengths (3–13\\xa0$\\\\mu$m). It gathers data for half a million stars, i.e. nearly all the stars of the Hipparcos-Tycho catalogue whose spectral type is reported in the SIMBAD data base. We cross-match 26 data bases to provide basic information, binarity elements, angular diameter, magnitude and flux in the near and mid-infrared, as well as flags that allow us to identify the potential calibrators. The catalogue covers the entire sky with 465\\u2009857 stars, mainly dwarfs and giants from B to M spectral types closer than 18\\xa0kpc. The smallest reported values reach 0.16\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in L and 0.1\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in N for the flux, and 2\\xa0microarcsec for the angular diameter. We build four lists of calibrator candidates for the L and Nbands suitable with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) sub- and main arrays using the MATISSE instrument. We identify 1621 candidates for L and 44 candidates for N with the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), 375 candidates for both bands with the ATs, and 259 candidates for both bands with the Unit Telescopes (UTs). Predominantly cool giants, these sources are small and bright enough to belong to the primary lists of calibrator candidates.

By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

We conclude that the formation mechanism for multiple systems operates in a largely scale-invariant manner and precludes the formation of extremely uneven systems, likely because the components of a protobinary accrete most of their mass after the initial cloud fragmentation. Similarly, the mechanism to form ‘planetary’ (q ≲ 0.02) companions likely scales linearly with stellar mass, probably as a result of the correlation between the masses of stars and their protoplanetary discs. Finally, we predict the existence of a sizable population of brown dwarf companions to low-mass stars and of a rising population of planetary-mass objects towards ${\\\\approx}1\\\\,M_\\\\mathrm{Jup}$ around solar-type stars.

Short-cadence Observations of 4584 Eclipsing Binaries in Sectors 1–26<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>In this paper we present a catalog of 4584 eclipsing binaries observed during the first two years (26 sectors) of the TESS survey. We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

We explore statistical properties of the systems with a focus on both the stars and the planets. So far, about 30 triple systems and one to three quadruple systems, including (mildly) controversial cases, have been found. The total number of planets is close to 40. All planet-hosting triple-star systems are highly hierarchic, consisting of a quasi-binary complemented by a distant stellar component, which is in orbit about the common center of mass. Furthermore, the quadruple systems are in fact pairs of close binaries (“double–doubles”), with one binary harboring a planet. For the different types of star–planet systems, we introduce a template for the classifications of planetary orbital configurations in correspondence to the hierarchy of the system and the planetary host. The data show that almost all stars are main-sequence stars, as expected. However, the stellar primaries tend to be more massive (i.e., corresponding to spectral types A, F, and G) than expected from single-star statistics, a finding also valid for stellar secondaries but less pronounced. Tertiary stellar components are almost exclusively low-mass stars of spectral type M. Almost all planets have been discovered based on either the Radial Velocity method or the Transit method. Both gas giants (the dominant type) and terrestrial planets (including super-Earths) have been identified. We anticipate the expansion of this database in the light of future planetary search missions.</jats:p>', 'High-mass pulsators in eclipsing binaries observed using <i>TESS</i><jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Pulsations and binarity are both common features of massive stars. The study of pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binary systems holds great potential for constraining stellar structure and evolution theory. However, prior to the all-sky Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, few such systems had been discovered or studied in detail. We have inspected the TESS light curves of a large number of eclipsing binaries known to contain high-mass stars, and compiled a list of 18 objects which show intrinsic variability. The light curves were modelled both to determine the physical properties of the systems, and to remove the effects of binarity in order to leave residual light curves suitable for asteroseismic analysis. Precise mass and radius measurements were obtained for δ\\u2009Cir, CC\\u2009Cas, SZ\\u2009Cam V436\\u2009Per and V539\\u2009Ara. We searched the residual light curves for pulsation signatures and, within our sample of 18 objects, we find six definite and eight possible cases of β\\u2009Cephei pulsation, seven cases of stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability, and eight instances of possible slowly pulsating B (SPB) star pulsation. The large number of pulsating eclipsing systems we have identified makes asteroseismology of high-mass stars in eclipsing binaries a feasible avenue to constrain the interior physics of a large sample of massive stars for the first time.</jats:p>', 'An all-sky sample of intermediate- to high-mass OBA-type eclipsing binaries observed by TESS<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic>Intermediate- to high-mass stars are the least numerous types of stars, and they are less well understood than their more numerous low-mass counterparts in terms of their internal physical processes.

They are potential sources of interesting astrophysical phenomena such as compact object mergers, leading to supernovae, and gravitational wave events. However, many uncertainties remain in their often complex evolution. Here, we present the population synthesis code Multiple Stellar Evolution (mse), designed to rapidly model the stellar, binary, and dynamical evolution of multiple-star systems. mse\\xa0includes a number of new features not present in previous population synthesis codes: (1) an arbitrary number of stars, as long as the initial system is hierarchical, (2) dynamic switching between secular and direct N-body integration for efficient computation of the gravitational dynamics, (3) treatment of mass transfer in eccentric orbits, which occurs commonly in multiple-star systems, (4) a simple treatment of tidal, common envelope, and mass transfer evolution in which the accretor is a binary instead of a single star, (5) taking into account planets within the stellar system, and (6) including gravitational perturbations from passing field stars. mse, written primarily in the C++ language, will be made publicly available and has few prerequisites; a convenient python interface is provided. We give a detailed description of MSE and illustrate how to use the code in practice.

Since due to their excessive brightness, accurate enough spectrophotometric measurements of bright stars typically cannot be performed with modern large telescopes, we have employed historical 13-colour medium-narrow-band photometric data, gathered with quite reliable photomultipliers, to fit the spectrum of 1346\\xa0bright stars using stellar atmosphere models. This not only constitutes a useful compilation of bright spectrophotometric standards well spread in the celestial sphere, the UCM library of spectrophotometric spectra, but allows the generation of a catalogue of reference RGB magnitudes, with typical random uncertainties ∼0.01\\xa0mag. For that purpose, we have defined a new set of spectral sensitivity curves, computed as the median of 28\\xa0sets of empirical sensitivity curves from the literature, that can be used to establish a standard RGB photometric system. Conversions between RGB magnitudes computed with any of these sets of empirical RGB curves and those determined with the new standard photometric system are provided. Even though particular RGB measurements from single cameras are not expected to provide extremely accurate photometric data, the repeatability and multiplicity of observations will allow access to a large amount of exploitable data in many astronomical fields, such as the detailed monitoring of light pollution and its impact on the night sky brightness, or the study of meteors, Solar system bodies, variable stars, and transient objects. In addition, the RGB magnitudes presented here make the sky an accessible and free laboratory for the calibration of the cameras themselves.</jats:p>', 'Empirical bolometric correction coefficients for nearby main-sequence stars in the <i>Gaia</i> era<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Nearby detached double-lined eclipsing binaries with most accurate data were studied and 290 systems were found with at least one main-sequence component having a metallicity of 0.008 ≤ Z ≤ 0.040.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

We cross-match 26 data bases to provide basic information, binarity elements, angular diameter, magnitude and flux in the near and mid-infrared, as well as flags that allow us to identify the potential calibrators. The catalogue covers the entire sky with 465\\u2009857 stars, mainly dwarfs and giants from B to M spectral types closer than 18\\xa0kpc. The smallest reported values reach 0.16\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in L and 0.1\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in N for the flux, and 2\\xa0microarcsec for the angular diameter. We build four lists of calibrator candidates for the L and Nbands suitable with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) sub- and main arrays using the MATISSE instrument. We identify 1621 candidates for L and 44 candidates for N with the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), 375 candidates for both bands with the ATs, and 259 candidates for both bands with the Unit Telescopes (UTs). Predominantly cool giants, these sources are small and bright enough to belong to the primary lists of calibrator candidates. In the near future, we plan to measure their angular diameter with 1\\xa0per\\u2009cent accuracy.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

Previous work had indicated a basal level with asymmetric scatter to strong values. The discrepancy is primarily due to our improved treatment of extinction. We confirm statistically significant time variability in Mg2800 strength for one star.</jats:p>', 'TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. I.

The study of pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binary systems holds great potential for constraining stellar structure and evolution theory. However, prior to the all-sky Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, few such systems had been discovered or studied in detail. We have inspected the TESS light curves of a large number of eclipsing binaries known to contain high-mass stars, and compiled a list of 18 objects which show intrinsic variability. The light curves were modelled both to determine the physical properties of the systems, and to remove the effects of binarity in order to leave residual light curves suitable for asteroseismic analysis. Precise mass and radius measurements were obtained for δ\\u2009Cir, CC\\u2009Cas, SZ\\u2009Cam V436\\u2009Per and V539\\u2009Ara. We searched the residual light curves for pulsation signatures and, within our sample of 18 objects, we find six definite and eight possible cases of β\\u2009Cephei pulsation, seven cases of stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability, and eight instances of possible slowly pulsating B (SPB) star pulsation. The large number of pulsating eclipsing systems we have identified makes asteroseismology of high-mass stars in eclipsing binaries a feasible avenue to constrain the interior physics of a large sample of massive stars for the first time.</jats:p>', 'Local spiral structure based on the <i>Gaia</i> EDR3 parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> The astrometric satellite <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> is expected to significantly increase our knowledge as to the properties of the Milky Way.

This not only constitutes a useful compilation of bright spectrophotometric standards well spread in the celestial sphere, the UCM library of spectrophotometric spectra, but allows the generation of a catalogue of reference RGB magnitudes, with typical random uncertainties ∼0.01\\xa0mag. For that purpose, we have defined a new set of spectral sensitivity curves, computed as the median of 28\\xa0sets of empirical sensitivity curves from the literature, that can be used to establish a standard RGB photometric system. Conversions between RGB magnitudes computed with any of these sets of empirical RGB curves and those determined with the new standard photometric system are provided. Even though particular RGB measurements from single cameras are not expected to provide extremely accurate photometric data, the repeatability and multiplicity of observations will allow access to a large amount of exploitable data in many astronomical fields, such as the detailed monitoring of light pollution and its impact on the night sky brightness, or the study of meteors, Solar system bodies, variable stars, and transient objects.

The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A catalogue of stellar diameters and fluxes for mid-infrared interferometry★<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the Mid-infrared stellar Diameters and Fluxes compilation Catalogue (MDFC) dedicated to long-baseline interferometry at mid-infrared wavelengths (3–13\\xa0$\\\\mu$m). It gathers data for half a million stars, i.e. nearly all the stars of the Hipparcos-Tycho catalogue whose spectral type is reported in the SIMBAD data base. We cross-match 26 data bases to provide basic information, binarity elements, angular diameter, magnitude and flux in the near and mid-infrared, as well as flags that allow us to identify the potential calibrators. The catalogue covers the entire sky with 465\\u2009857 stars, mainly dwarfs and giants from B to M spectral types closer than 18\\xa0kpc. The smallest reported values reach 0.16\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in L and 0.1\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in N for the flux, and 2\\xa0microarcsec for the angular diameter. We build four lists of calibrator candidates for the L and Nbands suitable with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) sub- and main arrays using the MATISSE instrument. We identify 1621 candidates for L and 44 candidates for N with the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), 375 candidates for both bands with the ATs, and 259 candidates for both bands with the Unit Telescopes (UTs). Predominantly cool giants, these sources are small and bright enough to belong to the primary lists of calibrator candidates. In the near future, we plan to measure their angular diameter with 1\\xa0per\\u2009cent accuracy.</jats:p>', 'Infrared nebulae around bright massive stars as indicators for binary interactions<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>. Recent studies show that more than 70% of massive stars do not evolve as effectively single stars, but as members of interacting binary systems. The evolution of these stars is thus strongly altered compared to similar but isolated objects.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We investigate the occurrence of parsec-scale mid-infrared nebulae around early-type stars. If they exist over a wide range of stellar properties, one possible overarching explanation is non-conservative mass transfer in binary interactions, or stellar mergers.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. For ∼3850 stars (all OBA stars in the Bright Star Catalogue (BSC), Be stars, BeXRBs, and Be+sdO systems), we visually inspect WISE 22 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m images. Based on nebular shape and relative position, we distinguish five categories: offset bow shocks structurally aligned with the stellar space velocity, unaligned offset bow shocks, and centered, unresolved, and not classified nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

We searched for stellar and planetary companions to a volume-limited sample of solar-type stars within 25 pc. Using adaptive optics imaging observations from the Lick 3 m and Palomar 200″ Telescopes, we characterized the multiplicity of our sample stars, down to the bottom of the main sequence.

We additionally combined three decades of radial velocity (RV) data from the California Planet Search with newly collected RV data from Keck/HIRES and the Automated Planet Finder/Levy Spectrometer to search for planetary companions in these same systems. Using an updated catalog of both stellar and planetary companions, as well as detailed injection/recovery tests to determine our sensitivity and completeness, we measured the occurrence rate of planets among the single- and multiple-star systems.

Finally, we found evidence that giant planets in binary systems have a different semimajor-axis distribution than their counterparts in single-star systems. The planets in the single-star sample had a significantly higher occurrence rate outside of 1 au than inside 1 au by nearly 4<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>, in line with expectations that giant planets are most common near the snow line. However, the planets in the wide binary systems did not follow this distribution, but rather had equivalent occurrence rates interior and exterior to 1 au. This may point to binary-mediated planet migration acting on our sample, even in binaries wider than 100 au.</jats:p>', 'Astrometric Mass Ratios of 248 Long-period Binary Stars Resolved in Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Using the absolute astrometric positions and proper motions for common stars in the Hipparcos and Gaia catalogs separated by 24.75 yr in the mean epoch, we compute mass ratios for long-period, resolved binary systems without any astrophysical assumptions or dependencies, except the presence of inner binary subsystems that may perturb the observed mean proper motions. The mean epoch positions of binary companions from the Hipparcos Double and Multiple System Annex are used as the first epoch. The mean positions and proper motions of carefully cross-matched counterparts in Gaia EDR3 comprise the second epoch data. Selecting only results with sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio and discarding numerous optical pairs, we construct a catalog of 248 binary systems, which is published online.

The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets.

For the same pairs the total mass was also found astrophysically - by applying the mass-luminosity relation. The apparent magnitudes of the components were found in two different ways: by deriving them from total magnitudes and magnitude differences, and by taking their values directly from a catalogue. The results for these two approaches show no essential discrepancy. The values of total masses obtained dynamically have a large dispersion involving even completely unrealistic values. This is a clear indication that the input data are not sufficiently reliable. Nevertheless, in a large number of cases the agreement between total masses obtained by us in two different ways is quite satisfactory indicating that i) for many visual binaries, as a rule not too distant and with high-quality orbital elements, the dynamical total masses can be reliable; ii) the mass-luminosity relation yields quite satisfactory estimates for the component masses when they belong to the Main Sequence and iii) a correlation between the relative parallax error and orbit grade exists.</jats:p>', 'CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICE SPECKLE OBSERVATIONS OF BINARY STARS WITH THE WIYN*\\n                TELESCOPE.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'A speckle-imaging search for close and very faint companions to the nearest and brightest Wolf–Rayet stars<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Gravitationally bound companions to stars enable determinations of their masses, and offer clues to their formation, evolution, and dynamical histories. So motivated, we have carried out a speckle imaging survey of eight of the nearest and brightest Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars to directly measure the frequency of their resolvable companions, and to search for much fainter companions than hitherto possible. We found one new, close companion to each of WR 113, WR 115, and WR 120 in the separation range ∼0.2–1.2 arcsec2. Our results provide more evidence that similar-brightness, close companions to WR stars are common. More remarkably, they also demonstrate that the predicted, but much fainter and thus elusive companions to WR stars are now within reach of modern speckle cameras on 8-m class telescopes by finding the first example.

We propose an automated approach for the classification of stellar spectra in the optical region using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional machine learning (ML) methods with ‘shallow’ architecture (usually up to two hidden layers) have been trained for these purposes in the past. However, deep learning methods with a larger number of hidden layers allow the use of finer details in the spectrum which results in improved accuracy and better generalization. Studying finer spectral signatures also enables us to determine accurate differential stellar parameters and find rare objects. We examine various machine and deep learning algorithms like artificial neural networks, Random Forest, and CNN to classify stellar spectra using the Jacoby Atlas, ELODIE, and MILES spectral libraries as training samples. We test the performance of the trained networks on the Indo-U.S. Library of Coudé Feed Stellar Spectra (CFLIB). We show that using CNNs, we are able to lower the error up to 1.23 spectral subclasses as compared to that of two subclasses achieved in the past studies with ML approach. We further apply the trained model to classify stellar spectra retrieved from the SDSS data base with SNR &amp;gt; 20.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous.

In this work we identify 775 WD+AFGK candidates from TGAS (The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), a well-defined sample of stars with available parallaxes, and we measure radial velocities (RVs) for 275 of them with the aim of identifying close binaries. The RVs have been measured from high-resolution spectra obtained at the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope and the San Pedro Mártir 2.12 m Telescope and/or from available LAMOST DR6 (low-resolution) and RAVE DR5 (medium-resolution) spectra. We identify 23 WD+AFGK systems displaying more than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> RV variation among 151 systems for which the measured values are obtained from different nights. Our WD+AFGK binary sample contains both AFGK dwarfs and giants, with a giant fraction ∼43%.

We also determine the stellar parameters (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and radius) of the AFGK companions with available high-resolution spectra.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

This is the first analysis of such a large sample of eccentric eclipsing binaries in our Galaxy, and has enabled us to identify several systems that are worthy of further study. Bringing together data from various databases and surveys, supplemented with new observations, we have been able to trace the long-term evolution of the eccentric orbit over durations extending back up to several decades. Our present study explores a rather different sample of stars to those presented in the previously published catalogue of eccentric eclipsing binaries, sampling to fainter magnitudes, covering later spectral types, sensitive to different orbital periods with more than 50% of our systems having periods longer than six days. The typical apsidal motion in the sample is rather slow (mostly of order of centuries long), although in some cases this is less than 50 yr. All of the systems, except one, have eccentricities less than 0.5, with an average value of 0.23. Several of the stars also show evidence for additional period variability. In particular we can identify three systems in the sample, HD 44093, V611 Pup, and HD 313631, which likely represent relativistic apsidal rotators.</jats:p>', 'A new catalogue of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>A new catalogue of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits is presented.

By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

With 83 known red giants in binary systems, of which only ∼40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample is small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time base of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient size to allow a red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few stars in the He-core burning phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic>, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were previously unknown to host an oscillating giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26 000 days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar evolution from binary studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies. While for non-eclipsing binaries the inclination is unknown, such a seismically well-characterized sample will be a treasure trove in combination with <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> astrometric orbits for binary systems.</jats:p>', 'The White Dwarf Binary Pathways Survey.

In this work we identify 775 WD+AFGK candidates from TGAS (The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), a well-defined sample of stars with available parallaxes, and we measure radial velocities (RVs) for 275 of them with the aim of identifying close binaries. The RVs have been measured from high-resolution spectra obtained at the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope and the San Pedro Mártir 2.12 m Telescope and/or from available LAMOST DR6 (low-resolution) and RAVE DR5 (medium-resolution) spectra. We identify 23 WD+AFGK systems displaying more than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> RV variation among 151 systems for which the measured values are obtained from different nights. Our WD+AFGK binary sample contains both AFGK dwarfs and giants, with a giant fraction ∼43%. The close binary fractions we determine for the WD+AFGK dwarf and giant samples are ≃24% and ≃15%, respectively. We also determine the stellar parameters (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and radius) of the AFGK companions with available high-resolution spectra.

Our results indicate that the mutual inclination between the orbits of the binary hosts and the transiting planets are well aligned. Our results for close binary systems (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> &lt; 100 au) complement past work for wide planet host binaries from Gaia.</jats:p>', \"A Decade of Linear and Circular Polarimetry with the POLISH2 Polarimeter<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The POLISH2 optical polarimeter has been in operation at the Lick Observatory 3 m Shane telescope since 2011, and it was commissioned at the Gemini North 8 m in 2016. This instrument primarily targets exoplanets, asteroids, and the Crab Pulsar, but it has also been used for a wide variety of planetary, galactic, and supernova science. POLISH2's photoelastic modulators, employed instead of rotating wave plates or ferroelectric liquid crystal modulators, offer the unprecedented ability to achieve sensitivity and accuracy of order 1 ppm (0.0001%), which are difficult to obtain with conventional polarimeters. Additionally, POLISH2 simultaneously measures the intensity (Stokes <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>), linear polarization (Stokes <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>U</jats:italic>), and circular polarization (Stokes <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>), which fully describe the polarization state of incident light.

This can be attributed to circumstellar effects (e.g., debris disks and chromospheric activity). The star HD 101805 shows a peculiar wavelength dependence, indicating size distribution of scattering particles different from that of a typical interstellar medium.

While nine of the discs appear to be unstable to perturbations from their host binary based on a simple analysis of their inferred radii, we argue that the evidence for genuine instability is not strong, primarily because of uncertainty in the true disc radii, uncertainty in the boundaries of the unstable regions, and orbital projection effects. The binary separation distributions of the disc-bearing and disc-free systems are different at a confidence level of $99.4{{\\\\ \\\\rm per\\\\ cent}}$, indicating that binary separation strongly influences the presence of detectable levels of debris. No discs are detected for separations between ∼25 and 135\\u2009au; this is likely a result of binaries whose separations are comparable with typical disc radii clearing out their primordial circumstellar or circumbinary material via dynamical perturbations. The disc detection rate is $19^{+5}_{-3}{{\\\\ \\\\rm per\\\\ cent}}$ for binaries wider than 135\\u2009au, similar to the published results for single stars.

This period is a full factor of 2 shorter than the quadruple with the shortest outer period reported previously, VW LMi, where the two binary components orbit each other every 355\\xa0d. The target was observed by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite in full-frame images in sectors 14–16, 21–23, 41, 48, and 49, and produced two sets of primary and secondary eclipses. These show strongly non-linear eclipse timing variations (ETVs) with an amplitude of ∼0.1\\xa0d, where the ETVs of the primary and secondary eclipses and of the two binaries are all largely positively correlated. This highlights the strong dynamical interactions between the two binaries and confirms the compact quadruple configuration of TIC 219006972. The two eclipsing binaries are nearly circular, whereas the quadruple system has an outer eccentricity of about 0.25. The entire system is nearly edge-on, with a mutual orbital inclination between the two eclipsing binary star systems of about 1 deg.</jats:p>', 'Multiply eclipsing candidates from the TESS satellite<jats:p>We present a catalogue of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) targets that show multiple eclipses. In all of these stars, we detected two sets of eclipses, for which their two distinctive periods can be derived. These multiple stellar systems could either be doubly eclipsing quadruples or triple-star coplanar systems showing eclipses on the outer orbit in addition to the inner eclipses. In total, 116 systems were found to be doubly eclipsing, while 25 stars were identified as triply eclipsing triples. Several confirmed blends of two close sources were not included in our analysis. All these systems were identified by scanning the known eclipsing systems taken from the Variable Star Index database and checking their TESS light curves. The average period of the dominant pair, pair A, is 2.7 days in our sample, while for the second pair, pair B, the average period is 5.3 days. Several systems show evident eclipse timing variation (ETV) changes even from the short interval of the TESS data, indicating possible period changes and short mutual orbit. We also present evidence that the system V0871 Cen is probably a septuple-star system of architecture (Aa-Ab)-B-C-D. Most of the presented systems are adequately bright and show deep enough eclipses for observing, and therefore we call for new ground-based observations for these extremely interesting multiples. Owing to this motivation, we have included also the ephemerides for both pairs of each system, our catalogue also contains their depths of eclipses and the light-curve shapes as extracted from the TESS data. These new ground-based observations would be very useful for further derivation of the mutual movement of both pairs on their orbit via detection of the ETVs of both pairs for example.</jats:p>', 'New Pulsating Stars Detected in EA-type Eclipsing-binary Systems Based on TESS Data<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries are very important for understanding the structure of stellar interiors through asteroseismology because their absolute parameters such as their masses and radii can be determined with high precision based on photometric and spectroscopic data. The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'An all-sky sample of intermediate- to high-mass OBA-type eclipsing binaries observed by TESS<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic>Intermediate- to high-mass stars are the least numerous types of stars, and they are less well understood than their more numerous low-mass counterparts in terms of their internal physical processes.

By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

With 83 known red giants in binary systems, of which only ∼40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample is small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time base of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient size to allow a red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few stars in the He-core burning phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic>, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were previously unknown to host an oscillating giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26 000 days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar evolution from binary studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies. While for non-eclipsing binaries the inclination is unknown, such a seismically well-characterized sample will be a treasure trove in combination with <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> astrometric orbits for binary systems.</jats:p>', 'The White Dwarf Binary Pathways Survey.

In this work we identify 775 WD+AFGK candidates from TGAS (The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), a well-defined sample of stars with available parallaxes, and we measure radial velocities (RVs) for 275 of them with the aim of identifying close binaries. The RVs have been measured from high-resolution spectra obtained at the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope and the San Pedro Mártir 2.12 m Telescope and/or from available LAMOST DR6 (low-resolution) and RAVE DR5 (medium-resolution) spectra. We identify 23 WD+AFGK systems displaying more than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> RV variation among 151 systems for which the measured values are obtained from different nights. Our WD+AFGK binary sample contains both AFGK dwarfs and giants, with a giant fraction ∼43%.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'An all-sky sample of intermediate- to high-mass OBA-type eclipsing binaries observed by TESS<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic>Intermediate- to high-mass stars are the least numerous types of stars, and they are less well understood than their more numerous low-mass counterparts in terms of their internal physical processes.

However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

Since due to their excessive brightness, accurate enough spectrophotometric measurements of bright stars typically cannot be performed with modern large telescopes, we have employed historical 13-colour medium-narrow-band photometric data, gathered with quite reliable photomultipliers, to fit the spectrum of 1346\\xa0bright stars using stellar atmosphere models. This not only constitutes a useful compilation of bright spectrophotometric standards well spread in the celestial sphere, the UCM library of spectrophotometric spectra, but allows the generation of a catalogue of reference RGB magnitudes, with typical random uncertainties ∼0.01\\xa0mag. For that purpose, we have defined a new set of spectral sensitivity curves, computed as the median of 28\\xa0sets of empirical sensitivity curves from the literature, that can be used to establish a standard RGB photometric system. Conversions between RGB magnitudes computed with any of these sets of empirical RGB curves and those determined with the new standard photometric system are provided. Even though particular RGB measurements from single cameras are not expected to provide extremely accurate photometric data, the repeatability and multiplicity of observations will allow access to a large amount of exploitable data in many astronomical fields, such as the detailed monitoring of light pollution and its impact on the night sky brightness, or the study of meteors, Solar system bodies, variable stars, and transient objects. In addition, the RGB magnitudes presented here make the sky an accessible and free laboratory for the calibration of the cameras themselves.</jats:p>', 'Empirical bolometric correction coefficients for nearby main-sequence stars in the <i>Gaia</i> era<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Nearby detached double-lined eclipsing binaries with most accurate data were studied and 290 systems were found with at least one main-sequence component having a metallicity of 0.008 ≤ Z ≤ 0.040.

We use Petersen diagrams (period ratios), échelle diagrams, and the period–luminosity relation to identify the fundamental mode in 20 of those 40 stars and conclude that a further 8 stars are not pulsating in this mode. For the remaining 12, the fundamental mode cannot be unambiguously identified. Further mode identification is possible for 12 of the fundamental mode pulsators that have regular sequences of pulsation overtones in their échelle diagrams. We use stellar evolution models to determine statistically that the λ\\u2009Boo stars are only superficially metal weak. Simple pulsation models also better fit the observations at a metallicity of Z\\xa0= 0.01 than at Z\\xa0= 0.001. The TESS observations reveal the great potential of asteroseismology on λ\\u2009Boo stars, for determining precise stellar ages and shedding light on the origin(s) of the λ\\u2009Boo phenomenon.</jats:p>']\n",

We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions of stellar and substellar mass in orbit around nearby stars.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>.

Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects.

This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A catalogue of stellar diameters and fluxes for mid-infrared interferometry★<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the Mid-infrared stellar Diameters and Fluxes compilation Catalogue (MDFC) dedicated to long-baseline interferometry at mid-infrared wavelengths (3–13\\xa0$\\\\mu$m).

We cross-match 26 data bases to provide basic information, binarity elements, angular diameter, magnitude and flux in the near and mid-infrared, as well as flags that allow us to identify the potential calibrators. The catalogue covers the entire sky with 465\\u2009857 stars, mainly dwarfs and giants from B to M spectral types closer than 18\\xa0kpc. The smallest reported values reach 0.16\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in L and 0.1\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in N for the flux, and 2\\xa0microarcsec for the angular diameter.

We identify 1621 candidates for L and 44 candidates for N with the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), 375 candidates for both bands with the ATs, and 259 candidates for both bands with the Unit Telescopes (UTs).

The evolution of these stars is thus strongly altered compared to similar but isolated objects.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We investigate the occurrence of parsec-scale mid-infrared nebulae around early-type stars.

For ∼3850 stars (all OBA stars in the Bright Star Catalogue (BSC), Be stars, BeXRBs, and Be+sdO systems), we visually inspect WISE 22 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m images.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars.

We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'Temperature and Distance Dependence of Tidal Circularization in Close Binaries: A Catalog of Eclipsing Binaries in the Southern Hemisphere Observed by the TESS Satellite<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Tidal forces are important for understanding how close binary stars and compact exoplanetary systems form and evolve. However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

We find a clear dependency of stellar temperature and orbital separation in the eccentricities of close binaries. We compare our observations with predictions of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. We find that while cool binaries agree with the predictions of the equilibrium tide, a large fraction of binaries with temperatures between 6250 K and 10,000 K and orbital separations between <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sub>1</jats:sub> ∼ 4 and 10 are found on circular orbits, contrary to the predictions of the dynamical tide. This suggests that some binaries with radiative envelopes may be tidally circularized significantly more efficiently than usually assumed. Our findings on orbital circularization have important implications also in the context of hot Jupiters, where tides have been invoked to explain the observed difference in the spin–orbit alignment between hot and cool host stars.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

Once an overdensity, “agglomerate”, is identified, we carry out a data and bibliographic compilation of their star member candidates. The actual membership in agglomerate of each early‐type star is studied based on its heliocentric distance, proper motion, and previous spectro‐photometric information. We identify 35 agglomerates of early‐type Hipparcos stars. Most of them are associated to previously known clusters and OB associations.

We present an analysis of 61 high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of 36 systems with O-type primaries, among them 10 known particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries exhibiting synchrotron radio emission. Our sample consists of multiple systems with components at different evolutionary stages with wide and tight orbits and different types of interactions. For the treatment of the complex composite spectra of the multiple systems, we used a special procedure involving different line masks populated for each element separately. Out of the 36 systems, 22 exhibit in their least-squares deconvolution Stokes\\xa0V profiles definitely detected Zeeman features, among them 7 systems with colliding winds. For 14 systems, the detected Zeeman features are most likely associated with O-type components, whereas for 3 systems we suggest an association with an early B-type component. For the remaining five systems, the source of the field is unclear. Marginal evidence for the detection of a Zeeman feature is reported for 11 systems and non-detection for 3 systems. The large number of systems with definitely detected Zeeman features presents a mystery, but probably indicates that multiplicity plays a definite role in the generation of magnetic fields in massive stars. The newly found magnetic systems are supreme candidates for spectropolarimetric monitoring over their orbital and rotation periods to obtain trustworthy statistics on the magnetic field geometry and the distribution of field strength.</jats:p>', 'A rare phosphorus-rich star in an eclipsing binary from TESS<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> Few exoplanets around hot stars with radiative envelopes have been discovered, although new observations from the TESS mission are improving this.

There is also clear evidence for vertical stratification of P in the atmosphere of the star. The lack of Hg and the weak Mn overabundance suggests that this is not a typical HgMn star.

Here we present an investigation of the known eclipsing binary system BD+09\\xa01467 = V680\\xa0Mon. Using spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and own observations, we identify the primary component of the system as a mercury–manganese (HgMn/CP3) star (spectral type kB9 hB8 HeB9\\xa0V HgMn). Furthermore, photometric time series data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) indicate that the system is a ‘heartbeat star’, a rare class of eccentric binary stars with short-period orbits that exhibit a characteristic signature near the time of periastron in their light curves due to the tidal distortion of the components. Using all available photometric observations, we present an updated ephemeris and binary system parameters as derived from a modelling of the system with the elisa code, which indicate that the secondary star has an effective temperature of Teff\\xa0= $8300_{-200}^{+200}$ (spectral type ∼A4). V680\\xa0Mon is only the fifth known eclipsing CP3 star, and the first one in a heartbeat binary. Furthermore, our results indicate that the star is located on the zero-age main sequence and a possible member of the open cluster NGC\\xa02264. As such, it lends itself perfectly for detailed studies and may turn out to be a keystone in the understanding of the development of CP3 star peculiarities.</jats:p>', 'New eclipsing binaries with mercury–manganese stars<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Eclipsing binary stars are rare and extremely valuable astrophysical laboratories that make possible precise determination of fundamental stellar parameters. Investigation of early-type chemically peculiar stars in eclipsing binaries provides important information for understanding the origin and evolutionary context of their anomalous surface chemistry. In this study, we discuss observations of eclipse variability in six mercury–manganese (HgMn) stars monitored by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) satellite. These discoveries double the number of known eclipsing HgMn stars and yield several interesting objects requiring further study. In particular, we confirm eclipses in HD 72208, thereby establishing this object as the longest-period eclipsing HgMn star. Among five other eclipsing binaries, reported here for the first time, HD 36892 and HD 53004 stand out as eccentric systems showing heartbeat variability in addition to eclipses. The latter object has the highest eccentricity among eclipsing HgMn stars and also exhibits tidally induced oscillations. Finally, we find evidence that HD 55776 may be orbited by a white dwarf companion.</jats:p>', 'The very slow rotation of the magnetic O9.7\\u2009V star HD\\u200954879<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The first FOcal Reducer low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS\\u20092) spectropolarimetric observation of the longitudinal magnetic field of HD\\u200954879 of the order of −600\\u2009G with a lower limit of the dipole strength of ∼2\\u2009kG dates back to 2014. Since then, observations showed a gradual decrease of the absolute value of the mean longitudinal magnetic field. In the course of the most recent monitoring of HD\\u200954879 using FORS\\u20092 spectropolarimetric observations from 2017 October to 2018 February, a longitudinal magnetic field strength change from about −300\\u2009G down to about −90\\u2009G was reported. A sudden increase of the absolute value of the mean longitudinal magnetic field and an accompanying spectral variability was detected on 2018 February 17. New FORS\\u20092 spectropolarimetric data obtained from 2018 December to 2019 February confirm the very slow magnetic field variability, with the field decreasing from about 150\\u2009G to −100\\u2009G over 2 months. Such a slow magnetic field variability, related to the extremely slow rotation of HD\\u200954879, is also confirmed using high-resolution High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher in polarimetric mode and Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars spectropolarimetry. The re-analysis of the FORS\\u20092 polarimetric spectra from 2018 February indicates that the previously reported field increase and the change of the spectral appearance was caused by improper spectra extraction and wavelength calibration using observations obtained at an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The presented properties of HD\\u200954879 are discussed in the context of the Of?p spectral classification.</jats:p>', 'The chemical composition of the Herbig\\xa0Ae SB2 system AK\\xa0Sco (HD\\xa0152404)<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We investigate the stellar atmospheres of the two components of the Herbig Ae SB2 system AK\\xa0Sco to determine the elements present in the stars and their abundance. Equal stellar parameters Teff = 6500\\xa0K and log\\u2009\\u2009g = 4.5 were used for both stars. We studied HARPSpol spectra (resolution 110\\xa0000) that were previously used to state the presence of a weak magnetic field in the secondary. A composite synthetic spectrum was compared in the whole observed region λλ 3900–6912\\xa0Å with the observed spectrum. The abundances were derived mostly from unblended profiles, in spite of their sparsity, owing to the complexity of the system and to the not negligible v\\u2009sin\\u2009\\u2009i of 18\\xa0km\\xa0s−1 and 21\\xa0km\\xa0s−1 adopted for the two components, respectively.

Furthermore, overabundances were determined in both stars for Y, Ba, and La. Zirconium is overabundant only in the primary, while sulfur is overabundant outside the adopted error limits only in the secondary. In contrast to previous results showing a high occurrence rate of λ\\xa0Boo peculiarities or normal chemical composition among the Herbig Ae/Be stars, the abundance pattern of AK\\xa0Sco is similar to that of only few other Herbig stars displaying weak Ap/Bp peculiarities.

As opposed to other varieties of chemically peculiar stars such as classical Ap/Bp stars, HgMn stars lack strong magnetic fields and are defined by extreme overabundances of Mn, Hg, and other heavy elements. A satisfactory explanation for the abundance patterns remains to be determined, but low rotational velocity is a requirement and involvement in binary/multiple systems may be as well. The APOGEE HgMn sample currently consists of 269 stars that were identified among the telluric standard stars as those whose metallic absorption content is limited to or dominated by the H-band Mn\\u2009ii lines. Due to the fainter magnitudes probed by the APOGEE survey as compared to past studies, only 9/269 stars in the sample were previously known as HgMn types. The 260 newly identified HgMn stars represents a more than doubling of the known sample. At least 32\\xa0per\\u2009cent of the APOGEE sample are found to be binary or multiple systems, and from multi-epoch spectroscopy, we were able to determine orbital solutions for at least one component in 32 binaries. Many of the multilined systems include chemically peculiar companions, with noteworthy examples being the HgMn+Ap/Bp binary HD\\u20095429, the HgMn+HgMn binary HD\\u2009298641, and the HgMn+Bp\\u2009Mn\\xa0+\\xa0Am triple system HD\\u2009231263.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'MEGARA-GTC stellar spectral library – II.

The sample is assembled by combining several smaller samples studied in previously published work with targets from two unpublished Herschel surveys. We find that 38 systems show excess emission at 70 or 100\\u2009$\\\\mu$m suggestive of a debris disc. While nine of the discs appear to be unstable to perturbations from their host binary based on a simple analysis of their inferred radii, we argue that the evidence for genuine instability is not strong, primarily because of uncertainty in the true disc radii, uncertainty in the boundaries of the unstable regions, and orbital projection effects. The binary separation distributions of the disc-bearing and disc-free systems are different at a confidence level of $99.4{{\\\\ \\\\rm per\\\\ cent}}$, indicating that binary separation strongly influences the presence of detectable levels of debris. No discs are detected for separations between ∼25 and 135\\u2009au; this is likely a result of binaries whose separations are comparable with typical disc radii clearing out their primordial circumstellar or circumbinary material via dynamical perturbations. The disc detection rate is $19^{+5}_{-3}{{\\\\ \\\\rm per\\\\ cent}}$ for binaries wider than 135\\u2009au, similar to the published results for single stars. Only $8^{+2}_{-1}{{\\\\ \\\\rm per\\\\ cent}}$ of systems with separations below 25\\u2009au host a detectable disc, which may suggest that planetesimal formation is inhibited in binaries closer than a few tens of au, similar to the conclusions of studies of known planet-hosting binaries.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

Finally, the Fe K line profiles near 6.7 keV were constructed from the distribution of the photons as a function of the radial velocities of their emitting region.

The equatorial plane of the Be star and the orbital plane of the companion exhibit a relative inclination of 30°. We also identify a resolved comoving low-mass star, which leads us to propose that Achernar is a member of the Tucana-Horologium moving group.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> The proximity of Achernar makes this star a precious benchmark for stellar evolution models of fast rotators and intermediate mass binaries. Achernar A is presently in a short-lived phase of its evolution following the turn-off, during which its geometrical flattening ratio is the most extreme. Considering the orbital parameters, no significant interaction occurred between the two components, demonstrating that Be stars may form through a direct, single-star evolution path without mass transfer. Since component A will enter the instability strip in a few hundred thousand years, Achernar appears to be a promising progenitor of the Cepheid binary systems.</jats:p>', 'The spins of stripped B stars support magnetic internal angular momentum transport<jats:p>In order to predict the spins of stellar remnants we need to understand the evolution of the internal rotation of stars, and to identify at which stage the rotation of the contracting cores of evolved stars decouples from their expanding envelopes. The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost their entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation. After the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are well observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary of the galactic binary system <jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"aoi\">LB-1</jats:ext-link>, which was originally suggested to contain a massive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a fainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary’s spectrum signify extremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we investigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary evolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal angular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers are typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the stripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal angular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the observed slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar stars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the white dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass stripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately non-conservative.</jats:p>', 'Interferometric Detections of sdO Companions Orbiting Three Classical Be Stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Classical Be stars are possible products of close binary evolution, in which the mass donor becomes a hot, stripped O- or B-type subdwarf (sdO/sdB), and the mass gainer spins up and grows a disk to become a Be star. While several Be+sdO binaries have been identified, dynamical masses and other fundamental parameters are available only for a single Be+sdO system, limiting the confrontation with binary evolution models. In this work, we present direct interferometric detections of the sdO companions of three Be stars—28 Cyg, V2119 Cyg, and 60 Cyg—all of which were previously found in UV spectra. For two of the three Be+sdO systems, we present first orbits and preliminary dynamical masses of the components, revealing that one of them could be the first identified progenitor of a Be/X-ray binary with a neutron star companion. These results provide new sets of fundamental parameters that are crucially needed to establish the evolutionary status and origin of Be stars.</jats:p>', 'Dynamical Masses of the Primary Be Star and Secondary sdB Star in the Single-lined Binary κ Dra (B6  IIIe)<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Because many classical Be stars may owe their nature to mass and angular-momentum transfer in a close binary, the present masses, temperatures, and radii of their components are of high interest for comparison to stellar evolution models.

From a large and diverse optical spectroscopic database, only the radial velocity curve of the Be star could be extracted.

Previous cross-correlation of the observed FUV spectrum with O-type subdwarf (sdO) spectral model templates had not detected a companion belonging to the hot sdO population known from ∼20 earlier-type Be stars. Guided by our full 3D orbital solution, we found a strong cross-correlation signal for a stripped subdwarf B-type companion (FUV flux ratio of 2.3% ± 0.5%), enabling the first firm characterization of such a star and making <jats:italic>κ</jats:italic> Dra the first mid- to late-type Be star with a directly observed subdwarf companion.</jats:p>', 'Velocity monitoring of γ\\u2009Cas stars reveals their binarity status<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The binary status of γ\\u2009Cas stars has been discussed while theoretically examining the origin of their peculiar X-ray emission. However, except in two cases, no systematic radial velocity monitoring of these stars had been undertaken yet to clarify their status. We now fill this gap using TIGRE, CARMENES, and UVES high-resolution spectroscopy. Velocities were determined for 16 stars, revealing shifts and/or changes in line profiles. The orbit of six new binaries could be determined: the long periods (80–120\\u2009d) and small velocity amplitudes (5–7\\u2009km\\u2009s−1) suggest low mass companions (0.6–1\\u2009M⊙). The properties of the known γ\\u2009Cas binaries appear similar to those of other Be systems, with no clear-cut separation between them. One of the new systems is a candidate for a rare case of quadruple system involving a Be star. Five additional γ\\u2009Cas stars display velocity variations compatible with the presence of companions, but no orbital solution could yet be formally established for them hence they only receive the status of ‘binary candidate’.</jats:p>']\n",

The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets. It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the stellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. Nearby stars are particularly favorable targets for high precision astrometry.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions of stellar and substellar mass in orbit around nearby stars.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>.

Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects.

This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

It turned out that, in the range of −0.6 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.3, [C/Fe] shows a marginally increasing tendency with decreasing [Fe/H] with a slight upturn around [Fe/H] ∼ 0, [N/Fe] tends to somewhat decrease toward lower [Fe/H], and [O/Fe] systematically increases (and thus [C/O] decreases) with a decrease in [Fe/H]. While these results are qualitatively consistent with previous determinations mostly based on atomic lines, the distribution centers of these [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] at the near-solar metallicity are slightly negative by several hundredths of dex, which is interpreted as due to unusual solar abundances possibly related to the planetary formation of our solar system.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', '<i>Gaia</i> Early Data Release 3<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic> We produce a clean and well-characterised catalogue of objects within 100 pc of the Sun from the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> Early Data Release 3.

We searched for stellar and planetary companions to a volume-limited sample of solar-type stars within 25 pc. Using adaptive optics imaging observations from the Lick 3 m and Palomar 200″ Telescopes, we characterized the multiplicity of our sample stars, down to the bottom of the main sequence. With these data, we confirm field star multiplicity statistics from previous surveys. We additionally combined three decades of radial velocity (RV) data from the California Planet Search with newly collected RV data from Keck/HIRES and the Automated Planet Finder/Levy Spectrometer to search for planetary companions in these same systems. Using an updated catalog of both stellar and planetary companions, as well as detailed injection/recovery tests to determine our sensitivity and completeness, we measured the occurrence rate of planets among the single- and multiple-star systems.

The similarity in the planet occurrence rate around single stars and wide primaries implies that wide binary systems should actually host more planets than single-star systems, since they have more potential host stars.

The planets in the single-star sample had a significantly higher occurrence rate outside of 1 au than inside 1 au by nearly 4<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>, in line with expectations that giant planets are most common near the snow line. However, the planets in the wide binary systems did not follow this distribution, but rather had equivalent occurrence rates interior and exterior to 1 au. This may point to binary-mediated planet migration acting on our sample, even in binaries wider than 100 au.</jats:p>', 'A census of coronal mass ejections on solar-like stars<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may have major importance for planetary and stellar evolution. Stellar CME parameters, such as mass and velocity, have yet not been determined statistically. So far only a handful of stellar CMEs has been detected mainly on dMe stars using spectroscopic observations. We therefore aim for a statistical determination of CMEs of solar-like stars by using spectroscopic data from the ESO phase 3 and Polarbase archives. To identify stellar CMEs, we use the Doppler signal in optical spectral lines being a signature of erupting filaments that are closely correlated to CMEs. We investigate more than 3700\\xa0h of on-source time of in total 425 dF-dK stars. We find no signatures of CMEs and only few flares. To explain this low level of activity, we derive upper limits for the non-detections of CMEs and compare those with empirically modelled CME rates. To explain the low number of detected flares, we adapt a flare power law derived from EUV data to the H\\u2009α regime, yielding more realistic results for H\\u2009α observations. In addition, we examine the detectability of flares from the stars by extracting Sun-as-a-star H\\u2009α light curves. The extrapolated maximum numbers of observable CMEs are below the observationally determined upper limits, which indicates that the on-source times were mostly too short to detect stellar CMEs in H\\u2009α. We conclude that these non-detections are related to observational biases in conjunction with a low level of activity of the investigated dF-dK stars.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>. The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets.

Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs.

This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'Enrichment of the Galactic disc with neutron-capture elements: Mo and Ru<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present new observational data for the heavy elements molybdenum (Mo, Z = 42) and ruthenium (Ru, Z=\\xa044) in F-, G-, and K-stars belonging to different substructures of the Milky Way.

Using the method of population synthesis, we investigate the formation and the destiny of BeWDs, and discuss the effects of the metallicity (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>) and the common envelope evolution parameters.

Young open clusters are a likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-body interactions or in binary supernova explosions. The most energetic events may require dynamical interaction with massive black holes. The excellent quality of <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> astrometry opens up the path to study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high precision that the place of origin in open stellar clusters can be identified uniquely even when the star is a few kiloparsecs away. We developed an efficient minimization method to calculate whether two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against samples of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate trajectories for known runaway stars, which have previously been studied from H<jats:sc>IPPARCOS</jats:sc> astrometry as well as known open clusters. For runaways in our sample we used <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> data and updated radial velocities, and found that only half of the sample could be classified as runaways. The other half of the sample moves so slowly (&lt; 30 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) that they have to be considered as walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their trajectories. We then used cluster age and flight time of the stars to investigate whether the ejection was likely due to a binary supernova or due to a dynamical ejection. In particular we show that the classical runaways AE Aurigae and <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic> Columbae might not have originated together, with <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic> Columbae having an earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC.

The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost their entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation. After the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are well observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary of the galactic binary system <jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"aoi\">LB-1</jats:ext-link>, which was originally suggested to contain a massive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a fainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary’s spectrum signify extremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we investigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary evolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal angular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers are typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the stripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal angular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the observed slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar stars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the white dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass stripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately non-conservative.</jats:p>', 'The X-ray emission of Be+stripped star binaries★<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Using observations from Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton, we investigate the high-energy properties of all known (18) Be+sdO systems as well as seven additional Be binaries suspected to harbour stripped stars. The observed X-ray properties are found to be similar to those observed for other Be samples. The vast majority of these systems (15 out of 25) display very faint (and soft) X-ray emission, and six others are certainly not bright X-ray sources. Only two systems display γ\\u2009Cas characteristics (i.e. bright and hard X-rays), and one of them is a new detection: HD\\u200937202 (ζ\\u2009Tau). It presents an extremely hard spectrum due to a combination of high temperature and high absorption (possibly due to its high inclination). In parallel, it may be noted that the previously reported cyclic behaviour of this Be star has disappeared in recent years. Instead, shorter cycles and symmetric line profiles are observed for the Hα line. It had been recently suggested that the peculiar X-ray emissions observed in γ\\u2009Cas stars could arise from a collision between the disc of a Be star and the wind of its hot, stripped-star companion. The small fraction of γ\\u2009Cas analogues in this sample, as well as the properties of the known companions of the γ\\u2009Cas cases (low mass or not extremely hot, contrary to predictions), combined to the actual stripped-star and colliding-wind empirical knowledge, make the disc-wind collision an unlikely scenario to explain the γ\\u2009Cas phenomenon.</jats:p>', 'The Detection and Characterization of Be+sdO Binaries from HST/STIS FUV Spectroscopy<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The B emission-line stars are rapid rotators that were probably spun up by mass and angular momentum accretion through mass transfer in an interacting binary.

Here we report on Hubble Space Telescope/STIS far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of a sample of Be stars that reveals the presence of the hot sdO companion through the calculation of cross-correlation functions of the observed and model spectra. We clearly detect the spectral signature of the sdO star in 10 of the 13 stars in the sample, and the spectral signals indicate that the sdO stars are hot, relatively faint, and slowly rotating as predicted by models. A comparison of their temperatures and radii with evolutionary tracks indicates that the sdO stars occupy the relatively long-lived, He-core burning stage. Only 1 of the 10 detections was a known binary prior to this investigation, which emphasizes the difficulty of finding such Be+sdO binaries through optical spectroscopy. However, these results and others indicate that many Be stars probably host hot subdwarf companions.</jats:p>', 'A nearby recent supernova that ejected the runaway star ζ Oph, the pulsar PSR\\u2009B1706−16, and 60Fe found on Earth<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The detection of ∼1.5–3.2\\xa0Myr old 60Fe on Earth indicates recent nearby core-collapse supernovae.

We find kinematic evidence that the runaway ζ Oph and the radio pulsar PSR\\u2009B1706−16 were released by a supernova in a binary 1.78\\xa0±\\xa00.21\\xa0Myr ago at 107\\xa0±\\xa04\\xa0pc distance (for pulsar radial velocity 260\\xa0±\\xa043\\xa0km\\u2009s−1); association age and flight time determine the progenitor mass (16–18\\xa0M⊙), which can constrain supernova nucleosynthesis yields and 60Fe uptake on Earth. In addition, we notice that the only high-mass X-ray binary in Scorpius–Centaurus–Lupus (1H11255−567 with μ1 and μ2 Cru) may include a neutron star formed in another SN, up to ∼1.8\\xa0Myr ago at 89−112\\xa0pc, i.e. also yielding 60Fe detectable on Earth.

Using the method of population synthesis, we investigate the formation and the destiny of BeWDs, and discuss the effects of the metallicity (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>) and the common envelope evolution parameters.

This study is devoted to one of the most remarkable Be stars, V1294 Aql = HD 184279. We collected and analysed spectroscopic and photometric observations covering a time interval of about 25 000 d (68 yr).

The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost their entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation. After the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are well observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary of the galactic binary system <jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"aoi\">LB-1</jats:ext-link>, which was originally suggested to contain a massive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a fainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary’s spectrum signify extremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we investigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary evolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal angular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers are typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the stripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal angular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the observed slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar stars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the white dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass stripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately non-conservative.</jats:p>', 'Classifying Be Star Variability With TESS. I. The Southern Ecliptic<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>TESS photometry is analyzed for 430 classical Be stars observed in the first year of the mission. The often complex and diverse variability of each object in this sample is classified to obtain an understanding of the behavior of this class as a population. Ninety-seven percent of the systems are variable above the noise level, with timescales spanning nearly the entire range of what is accessible with TESS, from tens of minutes to tens of days. The variability seen with TESS is summarized as follows. Nearly every system contains multiple periodic signals in the frequency regime between about 0.5 and 4 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. One or more groups of closely spaced frequencies is the most common feature, present in 87% of the sample. Among the Be stars with brightening events that are characteristic of mass ejection episodes (18% of the full sample, or 31% of early-type stars), all have at least one frequency group, and the majority of these (83%) show a concurrent temporary amplitude enhancement in one or more frequency groups. About one-third (34%) of the sample is dominated by longer-term trends (timescales &gt;2 day). Low-frequency stochastic signals are prominent in about 25% of the sample, with varying degrees of intensity. Higher-frequency signals (6 &lt; <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> &lt; 15 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) are sometimes seen (in 15% of the sample) and in most cases likely reflect p-mode pulsation.

While several Be+sdO binaries have been identified, dynamical masses and other fundamental parameters are available only for a single Be+sdO system, limiting the confrontation with binary evolution models. In this work, we present direct interferometric detections of the sdO companions of three Be stars—28 Cyg, V2119 Cyg, and 60 Cyg—all of which were previously found in UV spectra. For two of the three Be+sdO systems, we present first orbits and preliminary dynamical masses of the components, revealing that one of them could be the first identified progenitor of a Be/X-ray binary with a neutron star companion. These results provide new sets of fundamental parameters that are crucially needed to establish the evolutionary status and origin of Be stars.</jats:p>', 'Velocity monitoring of γ\\u2009Cas stars reveals their binarity status<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The binary status of γ\\u2009Cas stars has been discussed while theoretically examining the origin of their peculiar X-ray emission.

Whereas it has been assumed that high-frequency pulsations among B-type main-sequence stars are confined to the early B-type β\\xa0Cephei stars, the observations indicate that high frequencies are to be found over the whole B-star range, eventually merging with δ\\xa0Scuti stars. The cool B stars pulsating in high frequencies are called Maia variables. It is shown that Maia variables are not rapidly rotating and thus cannot be β\\xa0Cephei pulsators that appear to have lower temperatures due to gravity darkening. In the region where β\\xa0Cephei variables are found, the proportion of pulsating stars is larger and amplitudes are higher and a considerable fraction pulsate in a single mode and low rotation rate. There is no distinct region of slowly pulsating B stars (SPB stars). Stars pulsating solely in low frequencies are found among all B stars. At most, only one-third of B stars appear to pulsate. These results, as well as the fact that a large fraction of A and B stars show rotational modulation, indicate a need for a revision of current ideas regarding stars with radiative envelopes.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

Recent studies show that more than 70% of massive stars do not evolve as effectively single stars, but as members of interacting binary systems. The evolution of these stars is thus strongly altered compared to similar but isolated objects.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We investigate the occurrence of parsec-scale mid-infrared nebulae around early-type stars. If they exist over a wide range of stellar properties, one possible overarching explanation is non-conservative mass transfer in binary interactions, or stellar mergers.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. For ∼3850 stars (all OBA stars in the Bright Star Catalogue (BSC), Be stars, BeXRBs, and Be+sdO systems), we visually inspect WISE 22 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m images.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>']\n",

A Comprehensive Analysis<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Stellar rotation is a fundamental observable that drives different aspects of stellar and planetary evolution. In this work, we present an unprecedented manifold analysis of 160 B-type stars with light curves collected by the TESS space mission using three different procedures (fast Fourier transform, Lomb–Scargle, and wavelet techniques), accompanied by rigorous visual inspection in the search for rotation periodicities. This effort provides rotational periodicities for 6 new TESS B-type stars and confirmed periodicities for 22 targets with rotation periods previously listed in the literature. For the other 61 stars, already classified as possible rotational variables, we identify noisy, pulsational, binarity, or ambiguous variability behavior rather than rotation signatures. The total sample of 28 potential rotators shows an overlap of different classes of rotational variables, composed of <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> Canum Venaticorum, rotating ellipsoidal, and SX Arietis stars.

Finally, the rotational periodicities reported in the present study may represent important constraints for improving stellar evolution models with rotation, as well as asteroseismic studies of hot stars.</jats:p>', 'TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars.

This confirms previous findings that a large fraction (about 40\\xa0per\\u2009cent) of A and B stars may exhibit rotational modulation. Gaia DR2 parallaxes were used to estimate luminosities, from which the radii and equatorial rotational velocities can be deduced. It is shown that observed values of the projected rotational velocities are lower than the estimated equatorial velocities for nearly all the stars, as they should be if rotation is the cause of the light variation. We conclude that a large fraction of main-sequence B stars appear to contain surface features which cannot likely be attributed to abundance patches.</jats:p>', 'A catalogue of stellar diameters and fluxes for mid-infrared interferometry★<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the Mid-infrared stellar Diameters and Fluxes compilation Catalogue (MDFC) dedicated to long-baseline interferometry at mid-infrared wavelengths (3–13\\xa0$\\\\mu$m).

A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars.

We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>']\n",

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems.

By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>', 'On the component masses of visual binaries<jats:p>In the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars we found those belonging to the Main Sequence to form a sample containing 432 visual binaries. Their total masses were obtained dynamically, i.e. they were calculated using the orbital elements and the new Hipparcos parallaxes. For the same pairs the total mass was also found astrophysically - by applying the mass-luminosity relation. The apparent magnitudes of the components were found in two different ways: by deriving them from total magnitudes and magnitude differences, and by taking their values directly from a catalogue. The results for these two approaches show no essential discrepancy. The values of total masses obtained dynamically have a large dispersion involving even completely unrealistic values. This is a clear indication that the input data are not sufficiently reliable. Nevertheless, in a large number of cases the agreement between total masses obtained by us in two different ways is quite satisfactory indicating that i) for many visual binaries, as a rule not too distant and with high-quality orbital elements, the dynamical total masses can be reliable; ii) the mass-luminosity relation yields quite satisfactory estimates for the component masses when they belong to the Main Sequence and iii) a correlation between the relative parallax error and orbit grade exists.</jats:p>', 'Mikrometermessungen von Doppelsternen (Veröffentlichungen der Sternwarte München Bd. 5 Nr. 11)<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Diese Liste enthält 1697 visuelle, am 11‐zölligen Münchner Refraktor ausgeführte Messungen von 340 Objekten.

The disk phenomenon is strongly correlated with rapid rotation, the origin of which remains unclear. It may be rooted in single- or binary-star evolution. In the framework of the binary channel, the initially more massive star transfers mass and angular momentum to the original secondary, which becomes a Be star. The system then evolves into a Be binary with a post-main-sequence companion, which, depending on the companion mass, may later be disrupted in a supernova event. Hence, if the binary channel dominates the formation of Be stars, one may expect a strong lack of close Be binaries with main sequence (MS) companions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic>We want to test the prediction of the binary channel.

In this paper, we continue our search for new cases by performing a limited survey of 18 Be stars using XMM–Newton. The targets were selected either on the basis of a previous X-ray detection (exosat,rosat, XMM-slew survey) without spectral information available or because of the presence of a peculiar spectral variability. Only two targets remain undetected in the new observations and three other stars display only faint and soft X-rays. Short-term and/or long-term variations were found in one third of the sample. The spectral characterization of the X-ray brightest 13 stars of the sample led to the discovery of three new γ\\u2009Cas (HD\\u200944458, HD\\u200945995, and V558\\u2009Lyr), bringing the total to 25 known cases, and another γ\\u2009Cas candidate (HD\\u2009120678), bringing the total to two.</jats:p>', 'TESS light curves of γ\\u2009Cas stars<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>γ Cas stars constitute a subgroup of Be stars showing unusually hard and bright X-ray emission.

The detected signals appear at low frequencies, with few cases of significant signals beyond 5\\u2009d−1 (and all of them are faint). The signal amplitudes, and sometimes the frequency content, change with time, even in the absence of outburst events.

The equatorial plane of the Be star and the orbital plane of the companion exhibit a relative inclination of 30°.

Achernar A is presently in a short-lived phase of its evolution following the turn-off, during which its geometrical flattening ratio is the most extreme. Considering the orbital parameters, no significant interaction occurred between the two components, demonstrating that Be stars may form through a direct, single-star evolution path without mass transfer. Since component A will enter the instability strip in a few hundred thousand years, Achernar appears to be a promising progenitor of the Cepheid binary systems.</jats:p>', 'The spins of stripped B stars support magnetic internal angular momentum transport<jats:p>In order to predict the spins of stellar remnants we need to understand the evolution of the internal rotation of stars, and to identify at which stage the rotation of the contracting cores of evolved stars decouples from their expanding envelopes. The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost their entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation. After the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are well observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary of the galactic binary system <jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"aoi\">LB-1</jats:ext-link>, which was originally suggested to contain a massive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a fainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary’s spectrum signify extremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we investigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary evolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal angular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers are typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the stripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal angular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the observed slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar stars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the white dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass stripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately non-conservative.</jats:p>', 'Interferometric Detections of sdO Companions Orbiting Three Classical Be Stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Classical Be stars are possible products of close binary evolution, in which the mass donor becomes a hot, stripped O- or B-type subdwarf (sdO/sdB), and the mass gainer spins up and grows a disk to become a Be star. While several Be+sdO binaries have been identified, dynamical masses and other fundamental parameters are available only for a single Be+sdO system, limiting the confrontation with binary evolution models. In this work, we present direct interferometric detections of the sdO companions of three Be stars—28 Cyg, V2119 Cyg, and 60 Cyg—all of which were previously found in UV spectra. For two of the three Be+sdO systems, we present first orbits and preliminary dynamical masses of the components, revealing that one of them could be the first identified progenitor of a Be/X-ray binary with a neutron star companion. These results provide new sets of fundamental parameters that are crucially needed to establish the evolutionary status and origin of Be stars.</jats:p>', 'Dynamical Masses of the Primary Be Star and Secondary sdB Star in the Single-lined Binary κ Dra (B6  IIIe)<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Because many classical Be stars may owe their nature to mass and angular-momentum transfer in a close binary, the present masses, temperatures, and radii of their components are of high interest for comparison to stellar evolution models.

However, except in two cases, no systematic radial velocity monitoring of these stars had been undertaken yet to clarify their status. We now fill this gap using TIGRE, CARMENES, and UVES high-resolution spectroscopy. Velocities were determined for 16 stars, revealing shifts and/or changes in line profiles. The orbit of six new binaries could be determined: the long periods (80–120\\u2009d) and small velocity amplitudes (5–7\\u2009km\\u2009s−1) suggest low mass companions (0.6–1\\u2009M⊙). The properties of the known γ\\u2009Cas binaries appear similar to those of other Be systems, with no clear-cut separation between them. One of the new systems is a candidate for a rare case of quadruple system involving a Be star. Five additional γ\\u2009Cas stars display velocity variations compatible with the presence of companions, but no orbital solution could yet be formally established for them hence they only receive the status of ‘binary candidate’.</jats:p>']\n",

With 83 known red giants in binary systems, of which only ∼40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample is small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time base of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient size to allow a red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few stars in the He-core burning phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic>, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were previously unknown to host an oscillating giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26 000 days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar evolution from binary studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies.

All the low-mass planet hosts in our sample show positive Δ[El/Fe] versus condensation temperature slopes, in particular, the star with the largest number of various planets.

In this work we identify 775 WD+AFGK candidates from TGAS (The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), a well-defined sample of stars with available parallaxes, and we measure radial velocities (RVs) for 275 of them with the aim of identifying close binaries. The RVs have been measured from high-resolution spectra obtained at the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope and the San Pedro Mártir 2.12 m Telescope and/or from available LAMOST DR6 (low-resolution) and RAVE DR5 (medium-resolution) spectra. We identify 23 WD+AFGK systems displaying more than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> RV variation among 151 systems for which the measured values are obtained from different nights. Our WD+AFGK binary sample contains both AFGK dwarfs and giants, with a giant fraction ∼43%. The close binary fractions we determine for the WD+AFGK dwarf and giant samples are ≃24% and ≃15%, respectively. We also determine the stellar parameters (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and radius) of the AFGK companions with available high-resolution spectra.

A Comprehensive Analysis<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Stellar rotation is a fundamental observable that drives different aspects of stellar and planetary evolution. In this work, we present an unprecedented manifold analysis of 160 B-type stars with light curves collected by the TESS space mission using three different procedures (fast Fourier transform, Lomb–Scargle, and wavelet techniques), accompanied by rigorous visual inspection in the search for rotation periodicities. This effort provides rotational periodicities for 6 new TESS B-type stars and confirmed periodicities for 22 targets with rotation periods previously listed in the literature. For the other 61 stars, already classified as possible rotational variables, we identify noisy, pulsational, binarity, or ambiguous variability behavior rather than rotation signatures. The total sample of 28 potential rotators shows an overlap of different classes of rotational variables, composed of <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> Canum Venaticorum, rotating ellipsoidal, and SX Arietis stars. The combination of the three techniques applied in our analysis offers a solid path to overcome the challenges in the discrimination of rotation from other variabilities in stellar light curves, such as pulsation, binarity, or other effects that have no physical meaning. Finally, the rotational periodicities reported in the present study may represent important constraints for improving stellar evolution models with rotation, as well as asteroseismic studies of hot stars.</jats:p>', 'TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars.

Short-cadence Observations of 4584 Eclipsing Binaries in Sectors 1–26<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>In this paper we present a catalog of 4584 eclipsing binaries observed during the first two years (26 sectors) of the TESS survey. We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions.

We find a clear dependency of stellar temperature and orbital separation in the eccentricities of close binaries. We compare our observations with predictions of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. We find that while cool binaries agree with the predictions of the equilibrium tide, a large fraction of binaries with temperatures between 6250 K and 10,000 K and orbital separations between <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sub>1</jats:sub> ∼ 4 and 10 are found on circular orbits, contrary to the predictions of the dynamical tide.

In addition to the orbital light-variation, which can be represented as a five-term Fourier cosine series with the frequencies forb, 2forb, 3forb, 4forb, and 6forb, where forb is the system’s orbital frequency, the star shows five low-amplitude but highly significant sinusoidal variations with frequencies fi (i\\xa0= 2, .., 5, 7) in the range from 0.16 to 0.92\\u2009d−1. With an accuracy better than 1σ, the latter frequencies obey the following relations: f2 − f4\\xa0= 2forb, f7 − f3\\xa0= 2forb, f5\\xa0= f3 − f4\\xa0= f7 − f2. We interpret the first two relations as evidence that two high-order ℓ\\xa0= 1, m\\xa0= 0 gravity modes are self-excited in the system’s tidally distorted primary component. The star is thus an ellipsoidal SPB variable. The last relations arise from the existence of the first-order differential combination term between the two modes. Fundamental parameters, derived from photometric data in the literature and the Hipparcos parallax, indicate that the primary component is close to the terminal stages of its main-sequence (MS) evolution. Extensive Wilson–Devinney modelling leads to the conclusion that best fits of the theoretical to observed light curves are obtained for the effective temperature and mass consistent with the primary’s position in the HR diagram and suggests that the secondary is in an early MS evolutionary stage.</jats:p>']\n",

The targets were selected either on the basis of a previous X-ray detection (exosat,rosat, XMM-slew survey) without spectral information available or because of the presence of a peculiar spectral variability.

A Comprehensive Analysis<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Stellar rotation is a fundamental observable that drives different aspects of stellar and planetary evolution. In this work, we present an unprecedented manifold analysis of 160 B-type stars with light curves collected by the TESS space mission using three different procedures (fast Fourier transform, Lomb–Scargle, and wavelet techniques), accompanied by rigorous visual inspection in the search for rotation periodicities. This effort provides rotational periodicities for 6 new TESS B-type stars and confirmed periodicities for 22 targets with rotation periods previously listed in the literature. For the other 61 stars, already classified as possible rotational variables, we identify noisy, pulsational, binarity, or ambiguous variability behavior rather than rotation signatures. The total sample of 28 potential rotators shows an overlap of different classes of rotational variables, composed of <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> Canum Venaticorum, rotating ellipsoidal, and SX Arietis stars. The combination of the three techniques applied in our analysis offers a solid path to overcome the challenges in the discrimination of rotation from other variabilities in stellar light curves, such as pulsation, binarity, or other effects that have no physical meaning. Finally, the rotational periodicities reported in the present study may represent important constraints for improving stellar evolution models with rotation, as well as asteroseismic studies of hot stars.</jats:p>', 'An all-sky sample of intermediate- to high-mass OBA-type eclipsing binaries observed by TESS<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic>Intermediate- to high-mass stars are the least numerous types of stars, and they are less well understood than their more numerous low-mass counterparts in terms of their internal physical processes.

These stars lack strong magnetic fields typical of magnetic Bp stars but occasionally exhibit non-uniform surface distributions of chemical elements. The physical origin and the extent of this spot formation phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we use 2-min cadence light curves of 64 HgMn stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during the first 2 yr of its operation to investigate the incidence of rotational modulation and pulsations among HgMn stars. We found rotational variability with amplitudes of 0.1–3 mmag in 84\\xa0per\\u2009cent of the targets, indicating ubiquitous presence of star-spots on HgMn-star surfaces. Rotational period measurements reveal six fast-rotating stars with periods below 1.2\\xa0d, including one ultra-fast rotator (HD\\u200914228) with a 0.34-d period.

The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets. It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the stellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. Nearby stars are particularly favorable targets for high precision astrometry.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions of stellar and substellar mass in orbit around nearby stars.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object.

Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects.

This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'Rotational modulation in TESS B stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Light curves and periodograms of 160 B stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space mission and 29 main-sequence B stars from Kepler and K2 were used to classify the variability type. There are 114 main-sequence B stars in the TESS sample, of which 45 are classified as possible rotational variables. This confirms previous findings that a large fraction (about 40\\xa0per\\u2009cent) of A and B stars may exhibit rotational modulation. Gaia DR2 parallaxes were used to estimate luminosities, from which the radii and equatorial rotational velocities can be deduced. It is shown that observed values of the projected rotational velocities are lower than the estimated equatorial velocities for nearly all the stars, as they should be if rotation is the cause of the light variation. We conclude that a large fraction of main-sequence B stars appear to contain surface features which cannot likely be attributed to abundance patches.</jats:p>', 'A catalogue of stellar diameters and fluxes for mid-infrared interferometry★<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We present the Mid-infrared stellar Diameters and Fluxes compilation Catalogue (MDFC) dedicated to long-baseline interferometry at mid-infrared wavelengths (3–13\\xa0$\\\\mu$m).

We cross-match 26 data bases to provide basic information, binarity elements, angular diameter, magnitude and flux in the near and mid-infrared, as well as flags that allow us to identify the potential calibrators. The catalogue covers the entire sky with 465\\u2009857 stars, mainly dwarfs and giants from B to M spectral types closer than 18\\xa0kpc. The smallest reported values reach 0.16\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in L and 0.1\\xa0$\\\\mu$Jy in N for the flux, and 2\\xa0microarcsec for the angular diameter. We build four lists of calibrator candidates for the L and Nbands suitable with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) sub- and main arrays using the MATISSE instrument. We identify 1621 candidates for L and 44 candidates for N with the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), 375 candidates for both bands with the ATs, and 259 candidates for both bands with the Unit Telescopes (UTs). Predominantly cool giants, these sources are small and bright enough to belong to the primary lists of calibrator candidates. In the near future, we plan to measure their angular diameter with 1\\xa0per\\u2009cent accuracy.</jats:p>', '3D mapping of young stars in the solar neighbourhood with <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p>We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> mission (<jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500\\u2006pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>,\\u2006<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\\u2004∼\\u2004218.5°\\u2005,\\u2005−\\u20052°, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.</jats:p>', 'Spectroscopic variability and magnetic fields of HgMn stars<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The discovery of exotic abundances, chemical inhomogeneities, and weak magnetic fields on the surface of late B‐type primaries in spectroscopic binaries has important implications not only for our understanding of the formation mechanisms of stars with Hg and Mn peculiarities themselves, but also for the general understanding of B‐type star formation in binary systems. The origin of the abundance anomalies observed in late B‐type stars with HgMn peculiarity is still poorly understood. The connection between HgMn peculiarity and membership in binary and multiple systems is supported by our observations during the last decade. The important result achieved in our studies of a large sample of HgMn stars is the finding that most HgMn stars exhibit spectral variability of various chemical elements, proving that the presence of an inhomogeneous distribution on the surface of these stars is a rather common characteristic and not a rare phenomenon. Further, in the studied systems, we found that all components are chemically peculiar with different abundance patterns. Generally, He and Si variable Bp stars possess large‐scale organised magnetic fields that in many cases appear to occur essentially in the form of a single large dipole located close to the centre of the star. The presence of magnetic fields in the atmospheres of HgMn stars has been demonstrated in several studies. In addition to the measurements of longitudinal and quadratic magnetic fields, this work also showed evidence for a relative magnetic intensification of Fe II lines produced by different magnetic desaturations induced by different Zeeman‐split components (© 2011 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Exploring the properties of young associations through their variables, <i>dippers</i>, and candidate exoplanets<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Young associations in star-forming regions are stellar systems that allow us to understand the mechanisms that characterize the stars in their early life and what happens around them. In particular, the analysis of the discs and of the exoplanets around young stars allows us to know the key processes that prevail in their evolution and understand the properties of the exoplanets orbiting older stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission is giving us the opportunity to extract and analyse the light curves of association members with high accuracy, but the crowding that affects these regions makes difficult the light curve extraction. In the PATHOS project, cutting-edge tools are used to extract high-precision light curves and identify variable stars and transiting exoplanets in open clusters and associations. In this work, I analysed the light curves of stars in five young (≲10\\u2009Myr) associations, searching for variables and candidate exoplanets. Using the rotational periods of the association members, I constrained the ages of the five stellar systems (∼2–10\\u2009Myr). I searched for dippers, and I investigated the properties of the dust that forms the circumstellar discs. Finally, I searched for transiting signals, finding six strong candidate exoplanets. No candidates with radius RP ≲ 0.9\\xa0RJ have been detected, in agreement with the expectations. The frequency of giant planets resulted to be ∼2–3\\u2009per\\u2009cent, higher than that expected for field stars (≲ 1\\u2009per\\u2009cent); the low statistic makes this conclusion not strong, and new investigations on young objects are mandatory to confirm this result.</jats:p>', 'A ring in a shell: the large-scale 6D structure of the Vela OB2 complex<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae.

Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>']\n",

We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

The high-precision and continuous time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study these kinds of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol-type (EA-type) eclipsing-binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1–45 sectors with 2 minutes short cadence. By analyzing these TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that these binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between the pulsation and orbital periods of Algol-type oscillating eclipsing binaries (oEA stars), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing-binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate binary structures and evolution as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</jats:p>', 'Temperature and Distance Dependence of Tidal Circularization in Close Binaries: A Catalog of Eclipsing Binaries in the Southern Hemisphere Observed by the TESS Satellite<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Tidal forces are important for understanding how close binary stars and compact exoplanetary systems form and evolve. However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions. To determine the eccentricity distribution of eclipsing binaries over a wide range of stellar temperatures (3000–50,000 K) and orbital separations <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (2–300), we combine our newly obtained TESS sample with eclipsing binaries observed from the ground and by the Kepler mission. We find a clear dependency of stellar temperature and orbital separation in the eccentricities of close binaries. We compare our observations with predictions of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. We find that while cool binaries agree with the predictions of the equilibrium tide, a large fraction of binaries with temperatures between 6250 K and 10,000 K and orbital separations between <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sub>1</jats:sub> ∼ 4 and 10 are found on circular orbits, contrary to the predictions of the dynamical tide. This suggests that some binaries with radiative envelopes may be tidally circularized significantly more efficiently than usually assumed. Our findings on orbital circularization have important implications also in the context of hot Jupiters, where tides have been invoked to explain the observed difference in the spin–orbit alignment between hot and cool host stars.</jats:p>', 'Unveiling the power spectra of <i>δ</i> Scuti stars with TESS<jats:p>Thanks to high-precision photometric data legacy from space telescopes like CoRoT and <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic>, the scientific community could detect and characterize the power spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars.

In that way, we propose the frequency at maximum power (<jats:italic>ν</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) as a proper seismic index since it is directly related with the intrinsic temperature, mass and radius of the star. This parameter seems not to be affected by rotation, inclination, extinction or resonances, with the exception of the evolution of the stellar parameters. Furthermore, we can constrain rotation and inclination using the departure of temperature produced by the gravity-darkening effect.

With 83 known red giants in binary systems, of which only ∼40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample is small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time base of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient size to allow a red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few stars in the He-core burning phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic>, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were previously unknown to host an oscillating giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26 000 days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar evolution from binary studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies.

Because of this,\\n   nowadays, there are numerous astrometric ground-based observations (made over\\n   many decades) of some stars included in the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997).\\n   We used these latitude data for the inverse investigations - to improve the\\n   proper motions in declination ?? of the mentioned Hipparcos stars. We\\n   determined the corrections ??? and investigated agreement of our ?? and those\\n   from the catalogues Hipparcos and new Hipparcos (van Leeuwen 2007). To do\\n   this we used the latitude variations of 7 stations (Belgrade,\\n   Blagoveschtschensk, Irkutsk, Poltava, Pulkovo, Warsaw and Mizusawa), covering\\n   different intervals in the period 1904.7 - 1992.0, obtained with 6 visual and\\n   1 floating zenith telescopes (Mizusawa). On the other hand, with regard that\\n   about two decades have elapsed since the Hipparcos ESA mission observations\\n   (the epoch of Hipparcos catalogue is 1991.25), the error of apparent places\\n   of Hipparcos stars has increased by nearly 20 mas because of proper motion\\n   errors. Also, the mission lasted less than four years which was not enough\\n   for a sufficient accuracy of proper motions of some stars (such as double or\\n   multiple ones). Our method of calculation, and the calculated ?? for the\\n   common IL/Hipparcos stars are presented here. We constructed an IL catalogue\\n   of 1200 stars: there are 707 stars in the first part (with at least 20 years\\n   of IL observations) and 493 stars in the second one (less than 20 years). In\\n   the case of ?? of IL stars observed at some stations (Blagoveschtschensk,\\n   Irkutsk, Mizusawa, Poltava and Pulkovo) we find the formal errors less than\\n   the corresponding Hipparcos ones and for some of them (stations\\n   Blagoveschtschensk and Irkutsk) even less than the new Hipparcos ones.</jats:p>\"]\n",

We discuss a previously neglected constraint on mass, age, and evolutionary state of Betelgeuse and Antares, namely their observed colour evolution over historical times: We place all 236 stars bright enough for their colour to be discerned by the unaided eye (V ≤ 3.3 mag) on the colour-magnitude-diagram (CMD), and focus on those in the Hertzsprung gap. We study pre-telescopic records on star colour with historically critical methods to find stars that have evolved noticeably in colour within the last millennia. Our main result is that Betelgeuse was recorded with a colour significantly different (non-red) than today (red, B − V = 1.78\\xa0±\\xa00.05 mag). Hyginus (Rome) and Sima Qian (China) independently report it two millennia ago as appearing like Saturn (B − V = 1.09\\xa0±\\xa00.16 mag) in colour and ‘yellow’ (quantifiable as B − V = 0.95\\xa0±\\xa00.35 mag), respectively (together, 5.1σ different from today). The colour change of Betelgeuse is a new, tight constraint for single-star theoretical evolutionary models (or merger models). It is most likely located less than one millennium past the bottom of the red giant branch, before which rapid colour evolution is expected. Evolutionary tracks from MIST consistent with both its colour evolution and its location on the CMD suggest a mass of ∼14\\u2009M⊙ at ∼14\\xa0Myr. The (roughly) constant colour of Antares for the last three millennia also constrains its mass and age.

The mean epoch positions of binary companions from the Hipparcos Double and Multiple System Annex are used as the first epoch. The mean positions and proper motions of carefully cross-matched counterparts in Gaia EDR3 comprise the second epoch data. Selecting only results with sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio and discarding numerous optical pairs, we construct a catalog of 248 binary systems, which is published online. Several cases with unusual properties or results are also discussed.</jats:p>', 'Synthetic RGB photometry of bright stars: definition of the standard photometric system and UCM library of spectrophotometric spectra<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Although the use of RGB photometry has exploded in the last decades due to the advent of high-quality and inexpensive digital cameras equipped with Bayer-like colour filter systems, there is surprisingly no catalogue of bright stars that can be used for calibration purposes. Since due to their excessive brightness, accurate enough spectrophotometric measurements of bright stars typically cannot be performed with modern large telescopes, we have employed historical 13-colour medium-narrow-band photometric data, gathered with quite reliable photomultipliers, to fit the spectrum of 1346\\xa0bright stars using stellar atmosphere models. This not only constitutes a useful compilation of bright spectrophotometric standards well spread in the celestial sphere, the UCM library of spectrophotometric spectra, but allows the generation of a catalogue of reference RGB magnitudes, with typical random uncertainties ∼0.01\\xa0mag. For that purpose, we have defined a new set of spectral sensitivity curves, computed as the median of 28\\xa0sets of empirical sensitivity curves from the literature, that can be used to establish a standard RGB photometric system. Conversions between RGB magnitudes computed with any of these sets of empirical RGB curves and those determined with the new standard photometric system are provided. Even though particular RGB measurements from single cameras are not expected to provide extremely accurate photometric data, the repeatability and multiplicity of observations will allow access to a large amount of exploitable data in many astronomical fields, such as the detailed monitoring of light pollution and its impact on the night sky brightness, or the study of meteors, Solar system bodies, variable stars, and transient objects. In addition, the RGB magnitudes presented here make the sky an accessible and free laboratory for the calibration of the cameras themselves.</jats:p>', 'Pulsation among <i>TESS</i> A and B stars and the Maia variables<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Classification of over 50\\xa0000 TESS stars in sectors 1–18 has resulted in the detection of 766 pulsating main-sequence B stars as well as over 5000 δ\\xa0Scuti, 2300 γ\\xa0Doradus, and 114 roAp candidates. Whereas it has been assumed that high-frequency pulsations among B-type main-sequence stars are confined to the early B-type β\\xa0Cephei stars, the observations indicate that high frequencies are to be found over the whole B-star range, eventually merging with δ\\xa0Scuti stars. The cool B stars pulsating in high frequencies are called Maia variables. It is shown that Maia variables are not rapidly rotating and thus cannot be β\\xa0Cephei pulsators that appear to have lower temperatures due to gravity darkening. In the region where β\\xa0Cephei variables are found, the proportion of pulsating stars is larger and amplitudes are higher and a considerable fraction pulsate in a single mode and low rotation rate. There is no distinct region of slowly pulsating B stars (SPB stars). Stars pulsating solely in low frequencies are found among all B stars. At most, only one-third of B stars appear to pulsate. These results, as well as the fact that a large fraction of A and B stars show rotational modulation, indicate a need for a revision of current ideas regarding stars with radiative envelopes.</jats:p>', 'Stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars from <i>Gaia</i> DR2<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>. The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete, in particular toward the low-mass brown dwarf and long-period exoplanets. It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the stellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. Nearby stars are particularly favorable targets for high precision astrometry.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions of stellar and substellar mass in orbit around nearby stars.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> and <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc>) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets.

We also detect the signature of a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting <jats:italic>τ</jats:italic> Ceti.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>', 'A comparison of the local spiral structure from <i>Gaia</i> DR2 and VLBI maser parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context</jats:italic>.

We investigate the occurrence of parsec-scale mid-infrared nebulae around early-type stars.

In the BSC, we find that 28%, 13%, and 0.4% of all O, B, and A stars, respectively, possess associated infrared (IR) nebulae. Additionally, 34/234 Be stars, 4/72 BeXRBs, and 3/17 Be+sdO systems are associated with IR nebulae.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Aligned or unaligned bow shocks result from high relative velocities between star and interstellar medium (ISM) that are dominated by the star or the ISM, respectively. About 13% of the centered nebulae could be bow shocks seen head- or tail-on. For the rest, the data disfavor explanations as remains of parental disks, supernova remnants of a previous companion, and dust production in stellar winds. The existence of centered nebulae also at high Galactic latitudes strongly limits the global risk of coincidental alignments with condensations in the ISM. Mass loss during binary evolution seems a viable mechanism for the formation of at least some of these nebulae. In total, about 29% of the IR nebulae (2% of all OBA stars in the BSC) may find their explanation in the context of binary evolution.</jats:p>']\n",

We determine spin–orbit angles, obliquities, in 31 of these systems making use of recently improved apsidal motion rate measurements and apsidal motion constants. In the remaining 12 systems researchers have constrained spin–orbit alignment by different combinations of measurements of apsidal motion rates, projected obliquities, and stellar inclinations. Of the 43 systems 40 are consistent with alignment albeit with some measurements having large uncertainties. A Fisher distribution with mean zero and a concentration factor <jats:italic>κ</jats:italic> = 6.1 represents this ensemble well. Indeed employing a bootstrapping resampling technique we find our data on these 40 systems are consistent with perfect alignment.

The third misaligned system CV Vel orbits on a circular orbit.

We have inspected the TESS light curves of a large number of eclipsing binaries known to contain high-mass stars, and compiled a list of 18 objects which show intrinsic variability. The light curves were modelled both to determine the physical properties of the systems, and to remove the effects of binarity in order to leave residual light curves suitable for asteroseismic analysis.

However, tides are difficult to model, and significant uncertainties exist about the strength of tides. Here, we investigate tidal circularization in close binaries using a large sample of well-characterized eclipsing systems. We searched TESS photometry from the southern hemisphere for eclipsing binaries. We derive best-fit orbital and stellar parameters by jointly modeling light curves and spectral energy distributions. To determine the eccentricity distribution of eclipsing binaries over a wide range of stellar temperatures (3000–50,000 K) and orbital separations <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (2–300), we combine our newly obtained TESS sample with eclipsing binaries observed from the ground and by the Kepler mission. We find a clear dependency of stellar temperature and orbital separation in the eccentricities of close binaries. We compare our observations with predictions of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. We find that while cool binaries agree with the predictions of the equilibrium tide, a large fraction of binaries with temperatures between 6250 K and 10,000 K and orbital separations between <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\\n                  <jats:sub>1</jats:sub> ∼ 4 and 10 are found on circular orbits, contrary to the predictions of the dynamical tide. This suggests that some binaries with radiative envelopes may be tidally circularized significantly more efficiently than usually assumed. Our findings on orbital circularization have important implications also in the context of hot Jupiters, where tides have been invoked to explain the observed difference in the spin–orbit alignment between hot and cool host stars.</jats:p>']\n",

They are therefore ideal objects for a comparison of <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> data release 3 (GDR3) parallax data, especially since GDR3 presents the results of the non-single star (NSS) analysis that potentially results in improved parallaxes. This analysis is relevant in studying the parallax zero-point offset (PZPO) that is crucial in improving upon the distance scale. An sample of 192 orbital parallax determinations for 186 systems is compiled from the literature. The stars are also potentially in wide binary systems (WBS). A search was performed and 37 WBS (candidates) were found. Only for 21 objects does the NSS analysis provide information, including 8 from the astrometric binary pipeline, for which the parallaxes do improve significantly compared to those in the main catalogue with significant lower goodness-of-fit (GOF) parameters. It appears that most of the objects in the sample are eliminated in the pre-filtering stage of the NSS analysis. The difference between the orbital parallax and the (best) <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> parallax was finally obtained for 170 objects. A raw comparison is meaningless, however, due to limitations in accuracy both in the orbital and in <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> data. As many systems have been eliminated in the pre-filtering stage of the astrometric NSS pipeline, they remain in GDR3 with values for the GOF parameter in the range from several tens to several hundreds.

Parallax differences in magnitude bins and for the sample are presented. Three recipes from the literature that calculate the PZPO are tested. After these corrections are applied the remaining parallax differences are formally consistent with zero within the error bar for all three recipes. In all cases, an uncertainty in these averages of about 10–15 µas remains for these samples due to the small number statistics. The proof of concept of using orbital parallaxes is shown to work, but the full potential is not reached as an improved parallax from the NSS analysis is available for only for eight systems. In the final selection, the orbital parallax of 18 of 20 stars is known to better than 5%, and the parallax determination for 6 stars is better than from <jats:italic>Gaia.</jats:italic> In the full sample, 148 objects reach this precision in orbital parallax and therefore the full potential of using orbital parallaxes may hopefully be reached with GDR4.</jats:p>', 'Comparing Be Star Inclination Angles Determined from Hα Fitting and Gravitational Darkening<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Using a sample of 92 Galactic Be stars, we compare inclination angles (the angle between a star’s rotation axis and the line of sight) determined from H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> emission-line profile fitting to those determined by the spectroscopic signature of gravitational darkening.

The light curve also shows a clear reflection effect that is well modelled with a $2.5\\\\, {\\\\rm M}_{\\\\odot }$ main-sequence secondary, ruling out a lower mass BH or neutron star companion. We consider and reject models in which the system is a binary containing a stripped star orbiting the Be star: only a triple model with an outer Be star can explain both the observed light curve and radial velocities. Our results imply that the B star, whose slow projected rotation velocity and presumed tidal synchronization were interpreted as evidence for a low inclination (and thus a high companion mass), is far from being tidally synchronized: despite being in a 2.9\\xa0d orbit that is fully or nearly circularized (e &amp;lt; 0.04), its surface rotation period appears to be at least 20\\xa0d.

From a well-defined parent sample of 297 Be stars, we identified one mass-transfer binary, HD 15124. The object consists of a main-sequence Be star ($M_{\\\\rm Be}=5.3\\\\pm 0.6\\\\, {\\\\rm M}_{\\\\odot }$) with a low-mass ($M_{\\\\rm donor}=0.92\\\\pm 0.22\\\\, {\\\\rm M}_{\\\\odot }$), subgiant companion on a 5.47-d orbit. The emission lines originate in an accretion disc caused by ongoing mass transfer, not from a decretion disc as in classical Be stars. Both stars have surface abundances bearing imprint of CNO processing in the donor’s core: the surface helium fraction is YHe ≈ 0.6, and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio is 1000\\xa0times the solar value. The system’s properties are well-matched by binary evolution models in which mass transfer begins while a $3-5\\\\, {\\\\rm M}_{\\\\odot }$ donor leaves the main sequence, with the originally less massive component becoming the Be star. These models predict that the system will soon become a detached Be + stripped star binary like HR 6819 and LB-1, with the stripped donor eventually contracting to become a core helium-burning sdO/B star. Discovery of one object in this short-lived (∼1\\u2009Myr) evolutionary phase implies the existence of many more that have already passed through it and are now Be\\xa0+\\xa0sdO/B binaries.

The computation in converting altitudes to declinations and angles between stars to celestial positions is very accurate, with errors that are negligible with respect to the measurement errors. Due to an offset in the position of the vernal equinox, the positional error of the catalogue is slightly worse than that of Brahe’s catalogue; however, when a correction is made for the offset, which was known to 17th century astronomers, the catalogue is more accurate than that of Brahe by a factor of two.

We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for ≳99% of the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog (≈117\\u2006000 stars).</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. 30% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1−0.3\\u2006<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>J</jats:sub> to potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>orb</jats:sub>\\u2004=\\u20043 to 100 years). We confirm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> Cen. We recover the masses of the known companions of <jats:italic>ϵ</jats:italic> Eri, <jats:italic>ϵ</jats:italic> Ind, Ross 614 and <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> Pic. We also detect the signature of a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting <jats:italic>τ</jats:italic> Ceti.</jats:p>\\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the <jats:sc>HIPPARCOS</jats:sc> catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>(Δ<jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub>T</jats:sub>) = 1.0 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic>’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.</jats:p>']\n",

We find good agreement: 70% of the sample (64 out of 92 stars) is consistent with zero difference between the two methods using 1<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> errors, and there is a strong linear correlation coefficient between the two methods of <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = +0.63 ± 0.05. There is some evidence that the H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> profile fitting method overestimates the inclination angle for <jats:italic>i</jats:italic> ≲ 25°, perhaps due to the neglect of incoherent electron scattering on the H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> line widths, while the gravitational darkening method underestimates the inclination angle for <jats:italic>i</jats:italic> ≳ 70°, perhaps due to the neglect of disk radiative transfer effects on the optical spectrum.

They can originate from the binaries composed of a Be star and a subdwarf O or B star (BesdOBs), and they can merge into red giants via luminous red nova or can evolve into double WD potentially detected by the LISA mission. Using the method of population synthesis, we investigate the formation and the destiny of BeWDs, and discuss the effects of the metallicity (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>) and the common envelope evolution parameters. We find that BesdOBs are significant progenitors of BeWDs. About 30% (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> = 0.0001)−50% (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> = 0.02) of BeWDs come from BesdOBs. About 60% (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> = 0.0001) −70% (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> = 0.02) of BeWDs turn into red giants via a merger between a WD and a non-degenerated star. About 30% (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> = 0.0001) −40% (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> = 0.02) of BeWDs evolve into double WDs which are potential gravitational waves of the LISA mission at a frequency band between about 3 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> and 3 × 10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> Hz. The common envelope evolution parameter introduces an uncertainty with a factor of about 1.3 on BeWD populations in our simulations.</jats:p>', 'The origin of early-type runaway stars from open clusters<jats:p>Runaway stars are ejected from their place of birth in the Galactic disk, with some young B-type runaways found several tens of kiloparsecs from the plane traveling at speeds beyond the escape velocity, which calls for violent ejection processes. Young open clusters are a likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-body interactions or in binary supernova explosions. The most energetic events may require dynamical interaction with massive black holes. The excellent quality of <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> astrometry opens up the path to study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high precision that the place of origin in open stellar clusters can be identified uniquely even when the star is a few kiloparsecs away. We developed an efficient minimization method to calculate whether two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against samples of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate trajectories for known runaway stars, which have previously been studied from H<jats:sc>IPPARCOS</jats:sc> astrometry as well as known open clusters. For runaways in our sample we used <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> data and updated radial velocities, and found that only half of the sample could be classified as runaways. The other half of the sample moves so slowly (&lt; 30 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) that they have to be considered as walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their trajectories. We then used cluster age and flight time of the stars to investigate whether the ejection was likely due to a binary supernova or due to a dynamical ejection. In particular we show that the classical runaways AE Aurigae and <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic> Columbae might not have originated together, with <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic> Columbae having an earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC. The second sample investigated comprises a set of distant runaway B stars in the halo which have been studied carefully by quantitative spectral analyses. We are able to identify candidate parent clusters for at least four stars including the hyper-runaway candidate HIP 60350. The ejection events had to be very violent, ejecting stars at velocities as large as 150–400 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.</jats:p>', 'The spins of stripped B stars support magnetic internal angular momentum transport<jats:p>In order to predict the spins of stellar remnants we need to understand the evolution of the internal rotation of stars, and to identify at which stage the rotation of the contracting cores of evolved stars decouples from their expanding envelopes. The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost their entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation. After the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are well observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary of the galactic binary system <jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"aoi\">LB-1</jats:ext-link>, which was originally suggested to contain a massive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a fainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary’s spectrum signify extremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we investigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary evolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal angular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers are typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the stripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal angular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the observed slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar stars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the white dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass stripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately non-conservative.</jats:p>', 'The X-ray emission of Be+stripped star binaries★<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Using observations from Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton, we investigate the high-energy properties of all known (18) Be+sdO systems as well as seven additional Be binaries suspected to harbour stripped stars. The observed X-ray properties are found to be similar to those observed for other Be samples. The vast majority of these systems (15 out of 25) display very faint (and soft) X-ray emission, and six others are certainly not bright X-ray sources. Only two systems display γ\\u2009Cas characteristics (i.e. bright and hard X-rays), and one of them is a new detection: HD\\u200937202 (ζ\\u2009Tau). It presents an extremely hard spectrum due to a combination of high temperature and high absorption (possibly due to its high inclination). In parallel, it may be noted that the previously reported cyclic behaviour of this Be star has disappeared in recent years. Instead, shorter cycles and symmetric line profiles are observed for the Hα line. It had been recently suggested that the peculiar X-ray emissions observed in γ\\u2009Cas stars could arise from a collision between the disc of a Be star and the wind of its hot, stripped-star companion. The small fraction of γ\\u2009Cas analogues in this sample, as well as the properties of the known companions of the γ\\u2009Cas cases (low mass or not extremely hot, contrary to predictions), combined to the actual stripped-star and colliding-wind empirical knowledge, make the disc-wind collision an unlikely scenario to explain the γ\\u2009Cas phenomenon.</jats:p>', 'Local spiral structure based on the <i>Gaia</i> EDR3 parallaxes<jats:p><jats:italic>Context.</jats:italic> The astrometric satellite <jats:italic>Gaia</jats:italic> is expected to significantly increase our knowledge as to the properties of the Milky Way.

The clumped distribution of O-type stars also indicates that the Galaxy spiral structure is inhomogeneous.</jats:p>', 'The Detection and Characterization of Be+sdO Binaries from HST/STIS FUV Spectroscopy<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>The B emission-line stars are rapid rotators that were probably spun up by mass and angular momentum accretion through mass transfer in an interacting binary. Mass transfer will strip the donor star of its envelope to create a small and hot subdwarf remnant. Here we report on Hubble Space Telescope/STIS far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of a sample of Be stars that reveals the presence of the hot sdO companion through the calculation of cross-correlation functions of the observed and model spectra. We clearly detect the spectral signature of the sdO star in 10 of the 13 stars in the sample, and the spectral signals indicate that the sdO stars are hot, relatively faint, and slowly rotating as predicted by models. A comparison of their temperatures and radii with evolutionary tracks indicates that the sdO stars occupy the relatively long-lived, He-core burning stage. Only 1 of the 10 detections was a known binary prior to this investigation, which emphasizes the difficulty of finding such Be+sdO binaries through optical spectroscopy. However, these results and others indicate that many Be stars probably host hot subdwarf companions.</jats:p>']\n",
