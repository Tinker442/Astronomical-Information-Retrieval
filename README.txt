To get the results generated for the report, simply run all the cells in 'Main_project.ipynb'

To regenerate the dataset, run 'Generate_Data.py' (this takes days, but all data is already in the data folder)

Baseline Query contains code for generating baselines as well as code to aid in creating the queries_test.csv
